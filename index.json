The following example shows two ‚Äúprocesses‚Äù (P and Q) that can make an internal computation then synchronize with each other before continuing.\nWe can model asynchronous communication just as well using ‚Äúcommunication places‚Äù. For instance, in the following net, process Q can send a message msg (\\(msg!\\) is for emission and \\(msg?\\) stands for reception) and then continue with an internal action \\(b_2\\) before process P can receive it. Often, we need to add acknowledgment messages to ensure that messages are not queued up (meaning place c is bounded).\nWe will use this modeling approach in the following exercises.\nExercise 1. Resource allocation between one client and two managers # A client (C1) needs to access two resources (R1 and R2) in mutual exclusion in order to work. Thin of the example of the Printer job queue example. The resources are managed remotely by two different resource managers (M1 and M2). Communication between the client and the managers relies on three different messages (signals)\nReq request to access the resource\nAck acknowledgment authorizing the use of the resource\nFree client has finished and signal that the resource is freed\nThe behaviors of C1, M1 and M2 is as follows.\nClient C1 asks for the two resources sequentially; one after the other. First he asks for R1 then, when it as the resource, he asks access to R2. When he has both resources he enters into critical section (he works). Afterwards he frees the two resources simultaneously and comes back to its initial state.\nManager Gi (\\(i \\in \\{1,2\\}\\)) initially awaits for a reception of message Req from a client. Upon reception, he allows exclusive access to the resource to the client with message Ack. If the resource is not available, the request sits idle. The manager knows when the resource is available again when he receives message Free.\nModel the system with a P/T net (see remark below)\nSimulate the global (composed) system using the stepper\nBuild the marking graph and check whether there is a deadlock\nCheck whether the system is reinitialisable (check the SCC)\nRemark: to build the model, you can start from the description of the client C1 given in file (cl1.net). This is a Petri net in textual form (.net format).\nYou can use nd to draw the net. Then, taking inspiration from the client, write two separate net files for M1 and M2 (say in file m1.net and m2.net). Finally, compose the three files to build the whole system. To compose your sub-nets you can use the tpn format, e.g. use a script file (say sys.tpn) and open it with nd. In case of compilation error, you can use the command tina ‚Äìp sys.tpn to check the problem.\n# file sys.tpn # you can mix textual (.net) and graphical (.ndr) files source cl1.net source m1.ndr source m2.net Exercise 2. Resource allocation between two clients and two managers # We consider a second client (C2) that has a behavior equivalent to C1 except that he asks for resource R2 before R1.\nModel the second client and add it to the previous system using place composition as before. You will need to change the description of the two managers.\nUsing the stepper, find two scenarios that show the possibility of:\nDeadlock\nStarvation (a client that wants to work will be forever denied access to the resources)\nWe want to check mutual exclusion between the two clients working; meaning that places Cl1_work and Cl2_work cannot both have a token at the same time.\nHow can you show the property on the marking graph\nAdd a transition to your system that can fire if both places are marked and show that it is dead\nNow check mutual exclusion on the use of each one of the resources.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/courses/mccourse/tp3/","section":"Courses","summary":"\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eBackground \n    \u003cdiv id=\"background\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#background\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePetri nets transitions provide a direct way to encode communication between\nprocesses by synchronous communication.

See the manual page for tina for a description of the tpn format (http://projects.laas.fr/tina/manuals/formats.html).\nFor example, you could use a tpn script of the form:\n# we load a copy of mono.ndr and put a token in the start place load mono.ndr pl token(1) ren after1/exit # we push new copies of mono on \u0026#34;the stack\u0026#34; # and rename enter/exit to glue them correctly load mono.ndr ren after1/enter after2/exit # you can continue ‚Ä¶ ren after3/enter enter/exit sync 4 You can draw the resulting net with neato and check that everything is all right.\nQuestion 2 # Simulate the resulting net with the stepper and find possible problems in the models. You should find that this solution does not prevent starvation: a client may be willing to work (in place wait) but never enter critical section.\nQuestion 3 # Could you identify two main reasons that may lead to starvation? Find a scenario for each of these two cases.\nQuestion 4 # Propose a solution to correct this problem using inhibitor arcs and/or priorities if necessary. You can do it directly on the ndr file you have produced (keep a backup) and you only need to do it on a single site.\nQuestion 5 # We give a possible solution in Figure 2 (we just show it for site 1). Could you explain what are the meaning of transitions t3 and t4; likewise for places nbMax and frozen.\nCould you find an equivalent solution without inhibitor arcs?\nExercise 2. Dining philosophers # N philosophers are seated around a table in front of a plate of spaghettis. They can be in three possible states (thinking, waiting or eating). Each philosopher needs two forks to eat, one in each hand, but there is only one fork for each plate. So they need to take the fork to their left and the one to their right if they want to eat. These actions cannot be done at the same time, but the order is not fixed. This mean that two philosophers seated next to each other should never be able to eat at the same time.\nTake inspiration from the tpn script used in the previous exercise to model a system with N=4 philosophers. We will make different versions of increasing complexity.\nQuestion 1 # We consider a simplified version of the problem in which all the free forks can be found at the center of the tables. So you have a place, with N tokens initially, that models the number of free forks. The forks still need to be taken sequentially.\nQuestion 2 # Try to model the exact system, with exactly one fork between two adjacent philosophers.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/courses/mccourse/tp4/","section":"Courses","summary":"\u003chr\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eExercise 1.

behavioral analysis of asynchronous systems using state-space exploration and model checking techniques.\nThe MCC is part of a thriving group of scientific events dedicated to provide a fair evaluation of formal analysis tools, with the goal to push forward the state of the art and provide insights into the evolution of the involved technologies and approaches. We give details on the organization of the competition and on the ways we manage models and formulas. We also take a look at the evolution of the results over the 2018‚Äî2023 period, using the wide variety of data we collect each year, and report on the impact the MCC had on the competing tools.\nCitation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:TOOLympics2023, author = {Amat, Nicolas and Amparore, Elvio and Berthomieu, Bernard and Bouvier, Pierre and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano and Hulin-Hubard, Francis and Jensen, Peter Gj√∏l and Jezequel, Lo√Øg and Kordon, Fabrice and Li, Shuo and Paviot-Adet, Emmanuel and Petrucci, Laure and Srba, Ji≈ô√≠ and Thierry-Mieg, Yann and Wolf, Karsten}, title = {{Behind the Scene of the Model Checking Contest, Analysis of Results from 2018 to 2023}}, booktitle = {TOOLympics Challenge 2023 -- Updates, Results, Successes of the Formal-Methods Competitions}, series = {Lecture Notes in Computer Science}, volume = {14550}, publisher = {Springer-Verlag}, doi = {10.1007/978-3-031-67695-6_3}, month = nov, year = 2024 } ","date":"Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/toolympics2023/","section":"","summary":"Nicolas Amat, Elvio Amparore, Bernard Berthomieu, Pierre Bouvier, Silvano Dal Zilio, Francis Hulin-Hubard, Peter Gj√∏l Jensen, Lo√Øg Jezequel, Fabrice Kordon, Shuo Li, Emmanuel Paviot-Adet, Laure Petrucci, Ji≈ô√≠ Srba, Yann Thierry-Mieg, Karsten Wolf \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn \u003cem\u003eTOOLympics Challenge 2023\u003c/em\u003e ‚Äî \u003cem\u003eUpdates, Results, Successes of the Formal-Methods Competitions\u003c/em\u003e, nov 2024.","title":"Behind the Scene of the Model Checking Contest, Analysis of Results from 2018 to 2023","type":"publications"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/contest/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Contest","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/petri/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Petri","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tina/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tina","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/verification/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Verification","type":"tags"},{"content":"Nicolas Amat, Silvano Dal Zilio, Didier Le Botlan Fundamenta Informaticae 192(3-4), sep 2024. journal \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;DOI\u0026#12296;10.3233/FI-242197\u0026#12297; \u0026nbsp;HAL-04712076 Abstract # We propose an automated procedure to prove polyhedral abstractions (also known as polyhedral reductions) for Petri nets. Polyhedral abstraction is a new type of state space equivalence, between Petri nets, based on the use of linear integer constraints between the marking of places. In addition to defining an automated proof method, this paper aims to better characterize polyhedral reductions, and to give an overview of their application to reachability problems. Our approach relies on encoding the equivalence problem into a set of SMT formulas whose satisfaction implies that the equivalence holds. The difficulty, in this context, arises from the fact that we need to handle infinite-state systems. For completeness, we exploit a connection with a class of Petri nets, called flat nets, that have Presburger-definable reachability sets. We have implemented our procedure, and we illustrate its use on several examples.\nReferences # This is the extended version of a paper presented at the 44th International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency, jun 2023. \u0026nbsp;Link Citation # @Article{DalzilioS:fi2023polyprove, author = {Amat, Nicolas and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano and {Le Botlan}, Didier}, title = {{On the Complexity of Proving Polyhedral Reductions}}, journal = {Fundamenta Informaticae}, number = {3-4}, volume = {192}, doi = {10.3233/FI-242197}, month = sep, year = 2024 } ","date":"Sep 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/fi2023polyprove/","section":"","summary":"Nicolas Amat, Silvano Dal Zilio, Didier Le Botlan \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eFundamenta Informaticae\u003c/em\u003e 192(3-4), sep 2024.","title":"On the Complexity of Proving Polyhedral Reductions","type":"publications"},{"content":"","date":"Sep 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/reductions/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Reductions","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/octant/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Octant","type":"tags"},{"content":"Nicolas Amat, Silvano Dal Zilio, Didier Le Botlan In VMCAI 2024 ‚Äî Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation, jan 2024. conference paper \u0026nbsp;DOI\u0026#12296;10.1007/978-3-031-50524-9_5\u0026#12297; \u0026nbsp;HAL-04375443 Abstract # We propose a method for checking generalized reachability properties in Petri nets that takes advantage of structural reductions and that can be used, transparently, as a pre-processing step of existing model-checkers. Our approach is based on a new procedure that can project a property, about an initial Petri net, into an equivalent formula that only refers to the reduced version of this net. Our projection is defined as a variable elimination procedure for linear integer arithmetic tailored to the specific kind of constraints we handle. It has linear complexity, is guaranteed to return a sound property, and makes use of a simple condition to detect when the result is exact. Experimental results show that our approach works well in practice and that it can be useful even when there is only a limited amount of reductions.\nCitation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:vmcai2024octant, author = {Amat, Nicolas and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano and {Le Botlan}, Didier}, title = {{Project and Conquer: Fast Quantifier Elimination for Checking Petri Net Reachability}}, booktitle = {VMCAI 2024 -- Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation}, series = {Lecture Notes in Computer Science}, volume = {14499}, publisher = {Springer-Verlag}, doi = {10.1007/978-3-031-50524-9_5}, month = jan, year = 2024 } ","date":"Jan 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/vmcai2024octant/","section":"","summary":"Nicolas Amat, Silvano Dal Zilio, Didier Le Botlan \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn \u003cem\u003eVMCAI 2024\u003c/em\u003e ‚Äî \u003cem\u003eVerification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation\u003c/em\u003e, jan 2024.","title":"Project and Conquer: Fast Quantifier Elimination for Checking Petri Net Reachability","type":"publications"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tools/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tools","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Dec 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/kong/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Kong","type":"tags"},{"content":"Nicolas Amat, Silvano Dal Zilio, Didier Le Botlan International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer 25, dec 2023. journal \u0026nbsp;DOI\u0026#12296;10.1007/s10009-022-00694-8\u0026#12297; \u0026nbsp;HAL-03973463 Abstract # We propose a new method that takes advantage of structural reductions to accelerate the verification of reachability properties on Petri nets. Our approach relies on a state space abstraction, called polyhedral abstraction, which involves a combination between structural reductions and sets of linear arithmetic constraints between the marking of places. We propose a new data structure, called a Token Flow Graph (TFG), that captures the particular structure of constraints occurring in polyhedral abstractions. We leverage TFGs to efficiently solve two reachability problems: first to check the reachability of a given marking and then to compute the concurrency relation of a net, that is, all pairs of places that can be marked together in some reachable marking.

This verification challenge, proposed by Thales, was first discussed in 2014 as part of a dedicated workshop (FMTV, a satellite event of the FM 2014 conference), and solutions were discussed for the first time at the WATERS 2015 workshop. The use case for the verification challenge is an aerial video tracking system. A specificity of this system lies in the fact that periods are constant but known with a limited precision only. The first part of the challenge focuses on the video frame processing system. It consists in computing maximum values of the end-to-end latency of the frames sent by the camera to the display, for two different buffer sizes, and then the minimum duration between two consecutive frame losses. The second challenge is about computing end-to-end latencies on the tracking and camera control for two different values of jitter. Solutions based on five different tools - Fiacre/Tina, CPAL (simulation and analysis), IMITATOR, UPPAAL and MAST - were submitted for discussion at WATERS 2015. While none of these solutions provided a full answer to the challenge, a combination of several of them did allow to draw some conclusions.\nReferences # A companion paper, describing the artifacts used to answer the challenge appears in Dagstuhl Artifacts Series (DARTS) 9(1), jul 2023. \u0026nbsp;Link Citation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:ecrts2023waters, author = {Altmeyer, Sebastian and Andr√©, √âtienne and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano and Fejoz, Lo√Øc and {Gonz√°lez Harbour}, Michael and Graf, Susanne and Guti√©rrez, J.

Among the V\u0026amp;V techniques at our disposal, formal approaches are among the most rigorous and trustworthy ones. Yet, the level of skills and knowledge required to use and deploy formal methods is usually quite high and rare. In this paper, we describe an approach that starts from a regular, but rigorous, framework to specify and deploy robotic software components, which can also automatically synthesize a formal model of these components.\nWe describe how we can execute the resulting formal model, in place of a traditional implementation, and show how this provides the opportunity to add powerful monitoring and runtime verification capabilities to a system, e.g., to prevent collisions, or trigger an emergency landing. Since the runtime used to execute formal models is specifically designed to be faithful to their semantics, every execution (in the implementation) can be mapped to a trace in the specification. As a result, we can also prove many interesting properties offline, using model-checking techniques. We give several examples, such as properties about schedulability, worst-case traversal time, or mutual exclusion.\nWe believe that having a consistent workflow, from an initial specification of our system, down to a formal, executable specification is a major advance in robotics and opens the way for verification of functional components of autonomous robots and beyond. We illustrate this claim by describing a complete example based on a genuine drone flight controller.\nCitation # @Article{DalzilioS:ras2023hippo, author = {{Dal Zilio}, Silvano and Hladik, Pierre-Emmanuel and Ingrand, F√©lix and Anthony, Mallet}, title = {{A formal toolchain for offline and run-time verification of robotic systems}}, journal = {Robotics and Autonomous Systems}, volume = {159}, doi = {10.1016/j.robot.2022.104301}, month = jan, year = 2023 } ","date":"Jan 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/ras2023hippo/","section":"","summary":"Silvano Dal Zilio, Pierre-Emmanuel Hladik, F√©lix Ingrand, Mallet Anthony \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eRobotics and Autonomous Systems\u003c/em\u003e 159, jan 2023.","title":"A formal toolchain for offline and run-time verification of robotic systems","type":"publications"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/hippo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hippo","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/robotics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Robotics","type":"tags"},{"content":"Nicolas Amat, Bernard Berthomieu, Silvano Dal Zilio Fundamenta Informaticae 187(2-4), oct 2022. journal \u0026nbsp;DOI\u0026#12296;10.3233/FI-222134\u0026#12297; \u0026nbsp;HAL-03455697 Abstract # We define a new method for taking advantage of net reductions in combination with a SMT-based model checker. Our approach consists in transforming a reachability problem about some Petri net, into the verification of an updated reachability property on a reduced version of this net. This method relies on a new state space abstraction based on systems of constraints, called polyhedral abstraction. We prove the correctness of this method using a new notion of equivalence between nets. We provide a complete framework to define and check the correctness of equivalence judgements; prove that this relation is a congruence; and give examples of basic equivalence relations that derive from structural reductions. Our approach has been implemented in a tool, named SMPT, that provides two main procedures: Bounded Model Checking (BMC) and Property Directed Reachability (PDR). Each procedure has been adapted in order to use reductions and to work with arbitrary Petri nets. We tested SMPT on a large collection of queries used in the Model Checking Contest.

Basically, it means that every failure (a distinct instance of unobservable event) can be eventually detected after a finite number of observations. In this work, we are interested by the diagnosability of systems modelled using labelled Time Petri nets (TPN), an extension of Petri nets in which we can associate timing constraints to transitions. This means that we take into account the date at which events are observed and that we want to detect failures in a bounded time. We are also interested by the detection of patterns of events (sequence of observable events that are part of some given regular language) instead of the occurrence of a single fault.\nCitation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:movep2020twina, author = {Lubat, √âric and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano}, title = {{A Short Overview on Diagnosability of Patterns in Timed Petri Net}}, booktitle = {MOVEP 2020 -- 14th Summer School on Modelling and Verification of Parallel Processes}, month = jun, year = 2020 } ","date":"Jun 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/movep2020twina/","section":"","summary":"√âric Lubat, Silvano Dal Zilio \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn \u003cem\u003eMOVEP 2020\u003c/em\u003e ‚Äî \u003cem\u003e14th Summer School on Modelling and Verification of Parallel Processes\u003c/em\u003e, jun 2020.","title":"A Short Overview on Diagnosability of Patterns in Timed Petri Net","type":"publications"},{"content":"Thomas Hujsa, Bernard Berthomieu, Silvano Dal Zilio, Didier Le Botlan preprint, jun 2020. unpublished Abstract # Although decidable, the marking reachability problem for Petri nets is well-known to be intractable in general, and a non-elementary lower bound has been recently uncovered. In order to alleviate this difficulty, various structural and behavioral restrictions have been considered, allowing to relate reachability to properties that are easier to check. For a given initial marking, the set of potentially reachable markings is described by the state equation solutions and over-approximates the set of reachable markings.\nIn this paper, we delineate several subclasses of weighted Petri nets in which the set of reachable markings equals the set of potentially reachable ones, a property we call the PR-R equality. When fulfilled, this property allows to use linear algebra to answer the reachability questions, avoiding a brute-force analysis of the state space. Notably, we provide conditions under which this equality holds in classes much more expressive than marked graphs, adding places with several ingoing and outgoing transitions, which allows to model real applications with shared buffers. To achieve it, we investigate the relationship between liveness, reversibility, boundedness and potential reachability in Petri nets. We also show that this equality does not hold in classes with close modeling capability when the conditions are relaxed.\nCitation # @Unpublished{DalzilioS:RR2020preqr, author = {Hujsa, Thomas and Berthomieu, Bernard and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano and {Le Botlan}, Didier}, title = {{Checking marking reachability with the state equation in Petri net subclasses}}, month = jun, year = 2020 } ","date":"Jun 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/rr2020preqr/","section":"","summary":"Thomas Hujsa, Bernard Berthomieu, Silvano Dal Zilio, Didier Le Botlan \u003cbr /\u003e\npreprint, jun 2020.","title":"Checking marking reachability with the state equation in Petri net subclasses","type":"publications"},{"content":"","date":"Jun 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/concurrency/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Concurrency","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Jun 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mcc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mcc","type":"tags"},{"content":"Silvano Dal Zilio In ICATPN 2020 ‚Äî 41st International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency, jun 2020. conference paper \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;DOI\u0026#12296;10.1007/978-3-030-51831-8_23\u0026#12297; \u0026nbsp;HAL-02511881 Note # This paper won best teaser video award and an accessit to the tool demonstration video award.\nAbstract # MCC is a tool designed for a very specific task: to transform the models of High-Level Petri nets, given in the PNML syntax, into equivalent Place/Transition nets. The name of the tool derives from the annual Model-Checking Contest, a competition of model-checking tools that provides a large and diverse collection of PNML models. This choice in naming serves to underline the main focus of the tool, which is to provide an open and efficient solution that lowers the access cost for developers wanting to engage in this competition. We describe the architecture and functionalities of our tool and show how it compares with other existing solutions. Despite the fact that the problem we target is abundantly covered in the literature, we show that it is still possible to innovate. To substantiate this assertion, we put a particular emphasis on two distinctive features of MCC that have proved useful when dealing with some of the most challenging colored models in the contest, namely the use of a restricted notion of higher-order invariant, and the support of a Petri net scripting language.\nCitation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:petri2020mcc, author = {{Dal Zilio}, Silvano}, title = {{MCC: a Tool for Unfolding Colored Petri Nets in PNML Format}}, booktitle = {ICATPN 2020 -- 41st International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency}, series = {Lecture Notes in Computer Science}, volume = {12152}, publisher = {Springer-Verlag}, doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-51831-8_23}, pages = {426--435}, month = jun, year = 2020 } ","date":"Jun 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/petri2020mcc/","section":"","summary":"Silvano Dal Zilio \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn \u003cem\u003eICATPN 2020\u003c/em\u003e ‚Äî \u003cem\u003e41st International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency\u003c/em\u003e, jun 2020.","title":"MCC: a Tool for Unfolding Colored Petri Nets in PNML Format","type":"publications"},{"content":"Thomas Hujsa, Bernard Berthomieu, Silvano Dal Zilio, Didier Le Botlan preprint, may 2020. unpublished Abstract # Petri nets proved useful to describe various real-world systems, but many of their properties are very hard to check. To alleviate this difficulty, subclasses are often considered. The class of weighted marked graphs with relaxed place constraint (WMG=\u0026lt; for short), in which each place has at most one input and one output, and the larger class of choice-free (CF) nets, in which each place has at most one output, have been extensively studied to this end, with various applications. In this work, we develop new properties related to the fundamental and intractable problems of reachability, liveness and reversibility in weighted Petri nets. We focus mainly on the homogeneous Petri nets with a single shared place (H1S nets for short), which extend the expressiveness of CF nets by allowing one shared place (i.e. a place with at least two outputs and possibly several inputs) under the homogeneity constraint (i.e. all the output weights of the shared place are equal). Indeed, this simple generalization already yields new challenging problems and is expressive enough for modeling existing use-cases, justifying a dedicated study. One of our central results is the first characterization of liveness in a subclass of H1S nets more expressive than WMG=\u0026lt; that is expressed by the infeasibility of an integer linear program (ILP) of polynomial size. This trims down the complexity to co-NP, contrasting with the known EXPSPACE-hardness of liveness in the more general case of weighted Petri nets. In the same subclass, we obtain a new reachability property related to the live markings, which is a variant of the well-known Keller\u0026rsquo;s theorem. Another central result is a new reversibility characterization for the live H1S class, simplifying its checking. Finally, we apply our results to use-cases, highlight their scalability and discuss their extensibility to more expressive classes.\nCitation # @Unpublished{DalzilioS:RR2020ssplace, author = {Hujsa, Thomas and Berthomieu, Bernard and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano and {Le Botlan}, Didier}, title = {{On the Petri Nets with a Single Shared Place and Beyond}}, month = may, year = 2020 } ","date":"May 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/rr2020ssplace/","section":"","summary":"Thomas Hujsa, Bernard Berthomieu, Silvano Dal Zilio, Didier Le Botlan \u003cbr /\u003e\npreprint, may 2020.","title":"On the Petri Nets with a Single Shared Place and Beyond","type":"publications"},{"content":"Vincent Mussot, Silvano Dal Zilio, Lo√Øc Correnson, Serge Rainjonneau, Yves Bardout, Gr√©goire Scano In ERTSS 2020 ‚Äî 10th International Congress and Exhibition on Embedded Real-Time Software and Systems, jan 2020. conference paper \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;HAL-02462058 Note # Best Paper Awards in the category Autonomous and Connected Systems\nAbstract # We propose a new approach for modelling the functional behaviour of an Earth observation satellite.

This new service is needed in order to add more autonomy to satellites. To do so, we propose a new Domain Specific Modelling Language and the toolchain required for integration into an embedded software. This framework is based on the composition of deterministic finite state machines with safety conditions, timeouts, and transitions that accept durations as a parameter. It is able to generate code in the synchronous programming language Lustre from a high-level specification of the satellite. This gives a formal way to derive an event-based algorithm simulating the execution of telecommand sequence and, thereupon, a provably correct onboard verifier.\nCitation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:ertss2020satellite, author = {Mussot, Vincent and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano and Correnson, Lo√Øc and Rainjonneau, Serge and Bardout, Yves and Scano, Gr√©goire}, title = {{Formal Approach for the Verification of Onboard Autonomous Functions in Observation Satellites}}, booktitle = {ERTSS 2020 -- 10th International Congress and Exhibition on Embedded Real-Time Software and Systems}, month = jan, year = 2020 } ","date":"Jan 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/ertss2020satellite/","section":"","summary":"Vincent Mussot, Silvano Dal Zilio, Lo√Øc Correnson, Serge Rainjonneau, Yves Bardout, Gr√©goire Scano \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn \u003cem\u003eERTSS 2020\u003c/em\u003e ‚Äî \u003cem\u003e10th International Congress and Exhibition on Embedded Real-Time Software and Systems\u003c/em\u003e, jan 2020.","title":"Formal Approach for the Verification of Onboard Autonomous Functions in Observation Satellites","type":"publications"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/space/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Space","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Sep 2019","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/automates-et-grammaires/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Automates Et Grammaires","type":"series"},{"content":"I teach the following courses:\n","date":"Sep 2019","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/courses/","section":"Courses","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI teach the following courses:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Courses","type":"courses"},{"content":"","date":"Sep 2019","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":" Contenus du cours # Automates finis, Composition d\u0026rsquo;Automates, Automates hi√©rarchiques\nIntroduction √† la mod√©lisation de syst√®mes √† base d‚Äô√©tats (notion de syst√®mes √©tats transitions) Th√©orie des langages, Automates finis ind√©terministes/d√©terministes, D√©terminisation et minimisation des automates TD 1 : Mod√©lisation avec automates finis, D√©terminisation Rappels sur les langages (alphabet, mot, expressions r√©guli√®res); langages associ√©s aux expressions r√©guli√®res; suite sur les automates: d√©terminisation et minimisation\nTD 2 : Preuve d‚Äô√©quivalence, D√©terminisation √âquivalence : Automates finis, Expressions r√©guli√®res, Grammaires r√©guli√®res √† droite\nTD 3 : Equivalence : Automates finis, Expressions r√©guli√®res, Grammaires r√©guli√®res √† droite Automates √† piles, Ind√©terminisme, Equivalence grammaires alg√©briques, Analyse descendante r√©cursive\n√âl√©ments sur les langages context-free; notion de premiers, suivants, symboles directeurs, analyse descendante r√©cursive, \u0026hellip; TD 4 : Automates √† piles, Analyse descendante r√©cursive Machine de Turing, Introduction √† la Calculabilit√© et la Complexit√©\n","date":"Sep 2019","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/courses/ag/","section":"Courses","summary":"\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eContenus du cours \n    \u003cdiv id=\"contenus-du-cours\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#contenus-du-cours\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomates finis, Composition d\u0026rsquo;Automates, Automates hi√©rarchiques\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Automates et Th√©orie des Langages (cours 2SN - BML - ENSEEIHT)","type":"courses"},{"content":"√âric Lubat, Silvano Dal Zilio, Didier Le Botlan, Yannick Pencol√©, Audine Subias In FORMATS 2019 ‚Äî 17th International Conference on Formal Modeling and Analysis of Timed Systems, aug 2019. conference paper \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;DOI\u0026#12296;10.1007/978-3-030-29662-9_5\u0026#12297; \u0026nbsp;HAL-02263832 Abstract # We propose a new method for computing the language intersection of two Time Petri nets (TPN); that is the sequence of labels in timed traces common to the execution of two TPN.

For this, we give operational semantics to GenoM3, a robotic framework, in terms of timed transition systems TTS. Then, a mathematically proven translation to timed automata extended with urgencies and data DUTA is derived from such semantics. Thus, we provide a mapping from functional components to verifiable models. Since TTS and DUTA are at the heart of a large corpus of formal verification languages and tools (such as UPPAAL, Fiacre, and RT-BIP), the semantics and its translation allow a correct mapping between GenoM3 and such languages/tools.

Robotic software must thus run and perform as specified. Since most of these systems are used in a hard real-time context, the schedulability of their tasks is a crucial property. In this work, we propose to use formal methods to check whether the tasks of a robotic application are schedulable with respect to a given hardware platform. For this, we automatically translate functional components specified in GenoM into FIACRE, a formal language for timed systems. The generated models integrate realistic real-time schedulers based on the FCFS and the SJF cooperative policies. We use then the model-checker TINA to assert schedulability properties. We carry out experiments on a real robotic system, namely a quadcopter flight controller. We demonstrate that, on its actual hardware, schedulability properties can be formally expressed and verified. We give examples on how we can check other important behavioral and timed properties on the same synthesized models.\nCitation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:icse2018genom, author = {Foughali, Mohammed and Berthomieu, Bernard and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano and Hladik, Pierre-Emmanuel and Ingrand, F√©lix and Mallet, Anthony}, title = {{Formal Verification of Complex Robotic Systems on Resource-Constrained Platforms}}, booktitle = {FormaliSE -- 6th International Conference on Formal Methods in Software Engineering}, publisher = {ACM}, doi = {10.1145/3193992.3193996}, pages = {2--9}, month = jun, year = 2018 } ","date":"Jun 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/icse2018genom/","section":"","summary":"Mohammed Foughali, Bernard Berthomieu, Silvano Dal Zilio, Pierre-Emmanuel Hladik, F√©lix Ingrand, Anthony Mallet \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn \u003cem\u003eFormaliSE\u003c/em\u003e ‚Äî \u003cem\u003e6th International Conference on Formal Methods in Software Engineering\u003c/em\u003e, jun 2018.","title":"Formal Verification of Complex Robotic Systems on Resource-Constrained Platforms","type":"publications"},{"content":"Bernard Berthomieu, Didier Le Botlan, Silvano Dal Zilio In SPIN 2018 ‚Äî International Symposium on Model Checking Software, jun 2018. conference paper \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;DOI\u0026#12296;10.1007/978-3-319-94111-0_4\u0026#12297; \u0026nbsp;HAL-01822078 Abstract # We propose a method to count the number of reachable markings of a Petri net without having to enumerate these first.

To help the system architects comply with these requirements, network protocol standards like ARINC 429 and AFDX were created. Even though the behaviour of each component in a network is well defined, it is still necessary to test extensively every applications before deployment. But physical test benches used in the aircraft development process are complex and expensive platforms. In order to limit the need for physical tests, we propose a time-accurate middleware for virtualizing communication protocols that can be used to replace physical tests with simulations. We specified three formal models of AFDX networks that take into account temporal constraints with different levels of precision. We also developed a prototype for a network virtualization middleware based on the AFDX protocol specification that provides an easy-to-setup environment for testing network configurations. Finally, we used formal models together with virtualization in order to define runtime monitors for checking whether the behavior of the middleware is time-accurate with respect to a real system.\nCitation # @TechReport{DalzilioS:RR2018scalian, author = {Scarduelli, Rafael and Bourdil, Pierre-Alain and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano and {Le Botlan}, Didier}, title = {{Time-accurate Middleware for the Virtualization of Communication Protocols}}, institution = {LAAS}, number = {18126}, month = may, year = 2018 } ","date":"May 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/rr2018scalian/","section":"","summary":"Rafael Scarduelli, Pierre-Alain Bourdil, Silvano Dal Zilio, Didier Le Botlan \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eResearch Report 18126\u003c/em\u003e, LAAS, may 2018.","title":"Time-accurate Middleware for the Virtualization of Communication Protocols","type":"publications"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/safety/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Safety","type":"tags"},{"content":"Alexandre Albore, Silvano Dal Zilio, Marie De Roquemaurel, Christel Seguin, Pierre Virelizier In ERTS 2018 ‚Äî 9th European Congress on Embedded Real Time Software and Systems, jan 2018. conference paper \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;HAL-01709008 Abstract # In a previous work, we proposed an extension of the AltaRica language and tools to deal with the modelling and analysis of failures propagation in presence of timed and temporal constraints.

As systems become more complex‚Äîand include more and more interacting functions‚Äîit becomes harder to evaluate the safety implications of local failures and their possible propagation through a whole system. That is all the more true when we add time to the problem, that is when we consider the impact of computation times and delays on the propagation of failures. We describe an approach that extends models developed for Safety Analysis with timing information and provide tools to reason on the correctness of temporal safety conditions. Our approach is based on an extension of the AltaRica language where we can associate timing constraints with events and relies on a translation into a realtime model-checking toolset. We illustrate our method with an example that is representative of safety architectures found in critical systems.\nCitation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:imbsa2017altarica, author = {Albore, Alexandre and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano and Infantes, Guillaume and Seguin, Christel and Virelizier, Pierre}, title = {{A Model-Checking Approach to Analyse Temporal Failure Propagation with AltaRica}}, booktitle = {IMBSA 2017 -- 18th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods}, series = {Lecture Notes in Computer Science}, volume = {10437}, publisher = {Springer-Verlag}, doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-64119-5_10}, pages = {147--162}, month = sep, year = 2017 } ","date":"Sep 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/imbsa2017altarica/","section":"","summary":"Alexandre Albore, Silvano Dal Zilio, Guillaume Infantes, Christel Seguin, Pierre Virelizier \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn \u003cem\u003eIMBSA 2017\u003c/em\u003e ‚Äî \u003cem\u003e18th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods\u003c/em\u003e, sep 2017.","title":"A Model-Checking Approach to Analyse Temporal Failure Propagation with AltaRica","type":"publications"},{"content":"Ning Ge, Marc Pantel, Silvano Dal Zilio In TASE 2017 ‚Äî 11th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering, sep 2017. conference paper \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;DOI\u0026#12296;10.1109/TASE.2017.8285630\u0026#12297; \u0026nbsp;HAL-01589479 Abstract # To ease the expression of real-time requirements, Dwyer, and then Konrad, studied a large collection of existing systems in order to identify a set of real-time property patterns covering most of the useful use cases. The goal was to provide a set of reusable patterns that system designers can instantiate to express requirements instead of using complex temporal logic formulas. A limitation of this approach is that the choice of patterns is more oriented towards expressiveness than efficiency; meaning that it does not take into account the computational complexity of checking patterns. For this purpose, we define a set of verification-dedicated, atomic property patterns for qualitative and quantitative real-time requirements. End-user requirements can then be expressed as a composition of these patterns using a predefined meta-model and a mapping library. These properties can be checked efficiently using a set of elementary observers and a model checking approach.\nCitation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:tase2017patterns, author = {Ge, Ning and Pantel, Marc and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano}, title = {{Formal Verification of User-Level Real-Time Property Patterns}}, booktitle = {TASE 2017 -- 11th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering}, publisher = {IEEE Computer Society}, doi = {10.1109/TASE.2017.8285630}, month = sep, year = 2017 } ","date":"Sep 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/tase2017patterns/","section":"","summary":"Ning Ge, Marc Pantel, Silvano Dal Zilio \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn \u003cem\u003eTASE 2017\u003c/em\u003e ‚Äî \u003cem\u003e11th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering\u003c/em\u003e, sep 2017.","title":"Formal Verification of User-Level Real-Time Property Patterns","type":"publications"},{"content":"Projet Investissements d\u0026rsquo;Avenir - INGEQUIP (INGEni√©rie des EQUIPements) (Dec. 2013 - Nov. 2016) - Responsable : Fran√ßois Vernadat (INSA)\n","date":"Nov 2016","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/ingequip/","section":"","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDec 2013 ‚Äî Nov. 2016\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIngequip is a project on \u003cstrong\u003eMethods and tools for equipment engineering\u003c/strong\u003e\n(system-hardware-software co-design, component-based development methods, formal\nverification methods).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was supported by PIA (Projet Investissements d\u0026rsquo;Avenir) and the\n\u003cem\u003eEmbedded Systems\u003c/em\u003e technology domain at IRT Saint-Exup√©ry.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Ingequip","type":"projects"},{"content":"Mohammed Foughali, Bernard Berthomieu, Silvano Dal Zilio, F√©lix Ingrand, Anthony Mallet In ICFEM 2016 ‚Äî 18th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods, nov 2016. conference paper \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;DOI\u0026#12296;10.1007/978-3-319-47846-3_24\u0026#12297; \u0026nbsp;HAL-01346080 Abstract # Software is an essential part of robotic systems.

Indeed, formal verification is a complex process involving multiple methods, models, level of formality, \u0026hellip; If we want to use formal verification results in an assurance case, it is therefore necessary to build confidence on this process. The integration of formal methods raises particular problems like, for instance, with the construction of the verification models: a model may not preserve all properties of the system to be verified; it may only cover a subset of these properties; or it may be intractable. In practice, this means that the verification process involves a collection of models whose soundness (with the original system design, but also between each others) shall be justified. Furthermore, formal techniques are usually restricted in terms of the set of properties that can be checked. It is therefore necessary to justify (and trace back) that these restrictions are consistent with the hypotheses made about the system, its application and its environment. This short abstract gives an overview of a methodology for building verification arguments, that is convincing arguments that a system design complies with a set of properties.\nReferences # An extended version of this paper appears as Research Report LAAS N¬∞16115, July 2016. \u0026nbsp;Link Citation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:safecomp2016confidence, author = {{Dal Zilio}, Silvano and Bourdil, Pierre-Alain and Jenn, √âric}, title = {{Building Confidence on Formal Verification Models}}, booktitle = {SAFECOMP 2016 -- Fast Abstracts at International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability, and Security}, month = sep, year = 2016 } ","date":"Sep 2016","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/safecomp2016confidence/","section":"","summary":"Silvano Dal Zilio, Pierre-Alain Bourdil, √âric Jenn \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn \u003cem\u003eSAFECOMP 2016\u003c/em\u003e ‚Äî \u003cem\u003eFast Abstracts at International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability, and Security\u003c/em\u003e, sep 2016.","title":"Building Confidence on Formal Verification Models","type":"publications"},{"content":"","date":"Sep 2016","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/semantics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Semantics","type":"tags"},{"content":"Pierre-Alain Bourdil, Bernard Berthomieu, Silvano Dal Zilio, Fran√ßois Vernadat Science of Computer Programming 132(2):209‚Äî225, aug 2016. journal \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;DOI\u0026#12296;10.1016/j.scico.2016.08.008\u0026#12297; \u0026nbsp;HAL-01561994 Abstract # We propose a method to exploit the symmetries of a real-time system represented by a Time Petri net for its verification by model-checking.

In this context, a major problem is to prove the correctness of observers.

In this paper, we describe a method for automatically testing the correctness of realtime observers. This method is obtained by automating an approach often referred to as visual verification, in which the correctness of a system is performed by inspecting a graphical representation of its state space.

The goal of the project is an ‚ÄúOpen Proof‚Äù for the European Train Control System.\nThe Context # Europe‚Äôs railways have developed over the last 150 years within national boundaries, resulting in a variety of different signalling and train control systems, which hampers cross-border traffic. The European Union has decided to improve interoperability for the railway sector. Therefore the European Train Control System (ETCS) as part of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) is intended to replace almost all national legacy mainline signalling and train control systems all across Europe. ETCS consists of infrastructure components and on-board units (OBU). A System Requirement Specification (SRS, actual Version: 2.3.0d) has been cooperatively created mainly by 6 major European railway signalling manufacturers. Those firms have formed an association, called UNISIG to manage and coordinate these activities in close cooperation with the EU Commission and the bodies of railway operators. Beginning with the 3rd version of the SRS, this document has been published by the European Railway Agency (ERA), therefore in the‚Äúpublic domain‚Äù and will be mandatory by 2015 for all new infrastructure and train borne signalling and train control equipment.\nEspecially for the on-board part of the ETCS equipment the degree of functional complexity to be implemented has turned out to be significantly higher than in conventional signalling and train control systems, thus resulting in significant cost increases for software development, homologation and maintenance. This has caused a cost level for the operators, which is by a factor of 3 to 10 times higher compared with conventional national onboard systems at the same overall performance level.\nThe Goals and major expected outcomes # The purpose of the openETCS project is to develop an integrated modelling, development, validation and testing framework for leveraging the cost-efficient and reliable implementation of ETCS. The framework will provide a holistic tool chain across the whole development process of ETCS software. The tool chain will support the formal specification and verification of the ETCS system requirements, the automatic and ETCS compliant code generation and validation, and the model-based test case generation and execution. openETCS will utilize ‚ÄúOpen Standards‚Äù on all levels, including hardware and software specifica¬≠tion, interface definition, design tools, verification and validation procedures and last but not least embedded control software. By applying those technologies and related business concepts a significant cost cut for the final onboard product is expected down to or even below conventional high performance cab signalling systems (e.g. LZB Linien-Zug-Beeinflussung, as used in Germany, Austria and Spain).

Indeed, although SOA may sometimes be felt as just one more buzzword, it must be kept in mind that most of today\u0026rsquo;s greatest successes, in terms of bringing agility to the whole enterprise through its IT backbone, have been provided by SOA and its major technological counterparts that are the Web Services and the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). In this field, agility must be understood as \u0026ldquo;the combination of speed and adaptability: speed to bring new solutions to market more quickly, and adaptability to new business requirements and competitive pressure\u0026rdquo;.\nAt the same time, large control and command systems are envisaged, which may roughly be described as net- centric assemblies of heterogeneous lightweight sensors and actuators along with several large control systems. To accomplish such systems, there is currently a strong need of techniques at the cutting edge of technology that could bring seamless integration and deployment of lightweight embedded applications and IT services in a global agile system of services. In this context, ITEmIS aims at easing the evolution from today\u0026rsquo;s world of separate lightweight embedded applications and IT services to the future world of seamlessly integrated services, thus qualifying and defining a new generation SOA enabling IT and Embedded Integrated Systems (ITEmIS systems). This endeavour is undertaken along three main lines:\nAt business level, where IT/embedded services are integrated into advanced workflows supporting the multi-faceted interoperability and scalability required for ITEmIS systems;\nAt service infrastructure level, by introducing a specialized ESB-based and component-based solution addressing the requirements of the embedded world including deployment; and\nTransversally for both above levels addressing end-to-end assurance of Quality of Service (QoS) and correctness verification of deployments and workflows at the level of their execution models.\nTo tackle these three aspects, ITEmIS provides: a service-oriented middleware achieving deployment, run-time integration, and administration of the heterogeneous IT/embedded services into ITEmIS systems; and Model Driven Engineering (MDE)-based meta-models and tools for the modelling, development, deployment, administration and correctness verification of IT/embedded services and ITEmIS systems. ITEmIS goals towards enabling ITEmIS systems are highly challenging due to their special requirements deriving from the extreme heterogeneity of their constituent IT/embedded systems and their increased need for scalability and agility.\nOverall, ITEmIS aims at establishing an abstract reference system architecture, a methodology, and a set of algorithms (transformed into tools, mechanisms, protocols and correctness verification algorithms) for realizing ITEmIS systems. Due to its nature and objectives, ITEmIS should not be technology-specific and should enable integrating any new technology into the ITEmIS architecture. Nevertheless, in order to ensure proper exploitation opportunities, ITEmIS has a strong commitment in reusing today\u0026rsquo;s state-of-the-art standard technologies concerning the ESB infrastructure, the MDE/component-based design and development tooling, and the embedded-oriented lightweight component technologies.\nPartners # THALES Communications BM WebSourcig INRIA LAAS ScalAgent Distributed Technologies SA IRIT, Universit√© Paul Sabatier ","date":"Nov 2012","externalUrl":"","permalink":"/projects/itemis/","section":"","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOct 2008 ‚Äî Dec 2011.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eITEmIS (\u003cem\u003eIntegrated Embedded Systems and Information Systems\u003c/em\u003e) is a project\nfunded by ANR.

We evaluate the performance of different versions of our algorithm and compare our results with those obtained using other parallel model checking tools. One of the most novel contributions of this work is to study a space-efficient variant for CTL model-checking that does not require to store the whole transition graph but that operates, instead, on a reverse spanning tree.\nReferences # An extended version of this paper appears as Research Report LAAS N¬∞12139, March 2012. \u0026nbsp;PDF Citation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:atva2012mclcd, author = {{Tacla Saad}, Rodrigo and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano and Berthomieu, Bernard}, title = {{An Experiment on Parallel Model Checking of a CTL Fragment}}, booktitle = {ATVA 2012 -- 10th International Symposium on Automated Technology for Verification and Analysis}, series = {Lecture Notes in Computer Science}, publisher = {Springer-Verlag}, doi = {10.1007/978-3-642-33386-6_23}, month = oct, year = 2012 } ","date":"Oct 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/atva2012mclcd/","section":"","summary":"Rodrigo Tacla Saad, Silvano Dal Zilio, Bernard Berthomieu \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn \u003cem\u003eATVA 2012\u003c/em\u003e ‚Äî \u003cem\u003e10th International Symposium on Automated Technology for Verification and Analysis\u003c/em\u003e, oct 2012.","title":"An Experiment on Parallel Model Checking of a CTL Fragment","type":"publications"},{"content":"","date":"Oct 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/parallelism/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Parallelism","type":"tags"},{"content":"Silvano Dal Zilio, Nawal Guermouche In CollaborateCom 2012 ‚Äî 8th IEEE International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing, oct 2012. conference paper \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;DOI\u0026#12296;10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2012.250441\u0026#12297; \u0026nbsp;HAL-00578436 Abstract # In this paper, we propose an approach for analyzing and validating a composition of services with respect to real time properties.

The goal is to check whether a choreography of timed services satisfies given complex real time requirements. Our approach is based on a formal interpretation of timed choreographies in the Fiacre verification language that defines a precise model for the behavior of services and their timed interactions.

We consider the case of an observer-based model-checker, meaning that the relationship between a model and its specification is interpreted as the composition of the model with an observer of its behavior. In this context, a major problem is to prove the correctness of observers.\nIn this work, we deal with systems expressed using Fiacre, a formal modelling language for realtime, reactive systems. For requirements, we consider specifications expressed using a set of realtime verification patterns, which are translated into observers. We describe a graphical verification method that has been used to gain confidence on our interpretation of patterns into observers. Our method provides a formal, automatic way to check that an observer for a specification pattern is correct, that is, a proof that an observer faithfully captures the semantics of its associated pattern. This general approach is complementary to the use of more heavy-duty verification methods, such as interactive theorem prover, and can be used to debug the implementation of new observers.\nCitation # @TechReport{DalzilioS:checkmodelcheck, author = {{Dal Zilio}, Silvano and Abid, Nouha and Berthomieu, Bernard}, title = {{Who Checks the Model-Checkers?}}, institution = {LAAS}, number = {12367}, month = jul, year = 2012 } ","date":"Jul 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/checkmodelcheck/","section":"","summary":"Silvano Dal Zilio, Nouha Abid, Bernard Berthomieu \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eResearch Report 12367\u003c/em\u003e, LAAS, jul 2012.","title":"Who Checks the Model-Checkers?","type":"publications"},{"content":"\u0026ldquo;CESAR\u0026rdquo; stands for Cost-efficient methods and processes for safety relevant embedded systems and is a European funded project from ARTEMIS JOINT UNDERTAKING (JU).\nThe three transportation domains automotive, aerospace, and rail, as well as the automation domain share the need to develop ultra-reliable embedded systems to meet societal demands for increased mobility and ensuring safety in a highly competitive global market.\nTo maintain the European leading edge position in the transportation as well as automation market, CESAR aims to boost cost efficiency of embedded systems development and safety and certification processes by an order of magnitude.\nCESAR pursuits a multi-domain approach integrating large enterprises, suppliers, SME\u0026rsquo;s and vendors of cross sectoral domains and cooperating with leading research organizations and innovative SME\u0026rsquo;s.\nAbstract # The embedded safety-critical systems design and development industry is facing increasing complexity and variety of systems and devices, coupled with increasing regulatory constraints while costs, performances and time to market are constantly challenged.\nThis has led to a profusion of enablers (new processes, methods and tools), which are neither integrated nor interoperable because they have been developed more or less independently, addressing only a part of the complexity issue, such as safety. The absence of internationally recognized open standards is a limiting factor in terms of industrial performance when companies have to select among these enablers.\nCESAR will bring significant and conclusive innovations in the two most improvable systems engineering disciplines:\nRequirements engineering in particular through formalization of multi viewpoint, multi criteria and multi level requirements,\nComponent based engineering applied to design space exploration comprising multi-view, multi-criteria and multi level architecture trade-offs.\nMulti-viewpoint based development processes assure that not only functional aspects but also safety, costs, robustness, timeliness, etc. are captured and documented in a form allowing validation and verification to be performed. Multi-criteria based design processes allow for optimization of designs to multiple objectives functions for such extra-functional characteristics of designs, a key for achieving competitive products. Multi-level design flows cover all stages from initial concepts through requirements through specification to design and implementation, typically crossing multiple stages in supplier chains. The combination of these aspects will allow movement towards \u0026ldquo;first-time-right\u0026rdquo; designs, where the actual integration phases are free of negative surprises.\nIn addition, CESAR intends to provide industrial companies with a breakthrough in system development by deploying a customizable systems engineering \u0026ldquo;Reference Technology Platform\u0026rdquo; (RTP) making it possible to integrate or interoperate existing or emerging available technologies. This will be a significant step forward in terms of industrial performance improvement that will help to establish de-facto standards and contribute to the standardization effort from a European perspective. Relying on use-cases and scenarios from Aerospace, Automotive, Automation and Railway, CESAR is strongly industry driven. Benefiting from this multi-domains point of views, CESAR addresses safety aspects of transportation and other societal mobility and environmental demands.\nPartners # AVL List GmbH.

Our proposal is close in spirit to algorithms based on distributed hash tables, with the distinction that states are dynamically assigned to processors; i.e. we do not rely on an a-priori static partition of the state space.\nIn our solution, every process keeps a share of the global state space. Data distribution and coordination between processes is made through the localization table, that is a lockless, thread-safe data structure that approximates the set of states being processed. The localization table is used to dynamically assign newly discovered states and can be queried to return the identity of the processor that own a given state.

In addition to traditional observers based on the monitoring of places and transitions, we propose a new class of ob- servers based on the monitoring of data modifications that appears to be more efficient in practice.

While there are still gains to be expected from algorithmic improvements, it is necessary to take advantage of the advances in computer hardware to tackle bigger models. Recent improvements in this area take the form of multiprocessor and multicore architectures with access to large memory space.\nWe address the problem of generating the state space of finite-state transition systems; often a preliminary step for model-checking. We propose a novel algorithm for enumerative state space construction targeted at shared memory systems. Our approach relies on the use of two data structures: a shared Bloom filter to coordinate the state space exploration distributed among several processors and local dictionaries to store the states. The goal is to limit synchronization overheads and to increase the locality of memory access without having to make constant use of locks to ensure data integrity.\nBloom filters have already been applied for the probabilistic verification of systems; they are compact data structures used to encode sets, but in a way that false positives are possible, while false negatives are not. We circumvent this limitation and propose an original multiphase algorithm to perform exhaustive, deterministic, state space generations. We assess the performance of our algorithm on different benchmarks and compare our results with the solution proposed by Inggs and Barringer.\nCitation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:lockfreesscPDMC, author = {Berthomieu, Bernard and {Dal Zilio}, Silvano and {Tacla Saad}, Rodrigo}, title = {{A General Lock-Free Algorithm for Parallel State Space Construction}}, booktitle = {PDMC 2010 -- 9th International Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Methods in verifiCation}, publisher = {IEEE Computer Society}, doi = {10.1109/PDMC-HiBi.2010.10}, month = oct, year = 2010 } ","date":"Oct 2010","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/lockfreesscpdmc/","section":"","summary":"Bernard Berthomieu, Silvano Dal Zilio, Rodrigo Tacla Saad \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn \u003cem\u003ePDMC 2010\u003c/em\u003e ‚Äî \u003cem\u003e9th International Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Methods in verifiCation\u003c/em\u003e, oct 2010.","title":"A General Lock-Free Algorithm for Parallel State Space Construction","type":"publications"},{"content":"Nouha Abid, Silvano Dal Zilio preprint, jun 2010. unpublished \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;HAL-00494617 Note # presentation at MoVep 2010 ‚Äî summer school on Modelling and Verifying Parallel Processes\nAbstract # We present our ongoing research on the extension of the Fiacre language with real-time constructs and real-time verification patterns.

Toutefois, avant que les AOS ne deviennent une r√©alit√©, un certain nombre de d√©fis comme, entre autres, la s√©curit√© des services et la composition des services, doivent √™tre relev√©s. Avant d\u0026rsquo;accorder l\u0026rsquo;acc√®s aux ressources dont ils ont la responsabilit√©, les services √©tablissent leurs politiques de s√©curit√© et d√©crivent les conditions sous lesquelles telle ou telle ressource peut √™tre l√©galement utilis√©e. Par cons√©quent, les services interagissent avec leurs clients et avec d\u0026rsquo;autres services par le biais de protocoles cryptographiques afin d\u0026rsquo;obtenir leurs certificats et de caract√©riser leurs droits. La s√©curit√© des services traitent de la confidentialit√©, de l\u0026rsquo;int√©grit√©, et de la disponibilit√© en rapport avec la probl√©matique de la combinaison et de l\u0026rsquo;int√©gration des protocoles et des politiques. Les AOS permettent de r√©aliser des parcs d\u0026rsquo;organisations capables d\u0026rsquo;exporter leurs services √† des clients et de coop√©rer en composant des services via les r√©seaux.

La composition des services √©tudie les situations o√π les demandes des clients ne peuvent √™tre satisfaites qu\u0026rsquo;en combinant les services disponibles de mani√®re appropri√©e. Il y a quatre parties principales dans ce projet. En premier lieu, nous d√©finirons la famille des propri√©t√©s de s√©curit√© qui peuvent √™tre exig√©es des protocoles utilis√©s par les services et nous √©tudierons la faisabilit√© de la v√©rification automatique des propri√©t√©s de ces protocoles. En second lieu, nous formaliserons le type des contraintes qui peuvent √™tre impos√©es √† l\u0026rsquo;acc√®s aux ressources par les politiques et nous pr√©ciserons le type des politiques qui serviront d\u0026rsquo;interm√©diaire √† tous les acc√®s √† ces ressources. En troisi√®me lieu, nous examinerons les probl√®mes soulev√©s par l\u0026rsquo;usage concomitants des protocoles et des politiques et nous attaquerons les questions de d√©cidabilit√© et de complexit√© des nombreux probl√®mes d\u0026rsquo;accessibilit√© que cet usage concomitant implique.

This idea has already been successfully applied in the context of Document Type Definition (DTD), the simplest standard for defining document validity, but additional work is needed to take into account XML Schema, a more advanced standard, for which regular tree automata are not satisfactory. In this paper, we introduce Sheaves Logic (SL), a new tree logic that extends the syntax of the (recursion-free fragment of) W3C XML Schema Definition Language (WXS). Then, we define a new class of automata for unranked trees that provides decision procedures for the basic questions about SL: model-checking; satisfiability; entailment. The same class of automata is also used to answer basic questions about WXS, including recursive schemas: decidability of type-checking documents; testing the emptiness of schemas; testing that a schema subsumes another one.\nCitation # @Article{DalzilioS:xmlsheavesAAECC, author = {{Dal Zilio}, Silvano and Lugiez, Denis}, title = {{XML schema, tree logic and sheaves automata}}, journal = {Applicable Algebra in Engineering, Communication and Computing}, number = {5}, volume = {17}, doi = {10.1007/s00200-006-0016-7}, pages = {337--377}, month = oct, year = 2006 } ","date":"Oct 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/xmlsheavesaaecc/","section":"","summary":"Silvano Dal Zilio, Denis Lugiez \u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eApplicable Algebra in Engineering, Communication and Computing\u003c/em\u003e 17(5):337‚Äî377, oct 2006.","title":"XML schema, tree logic and sheaves automata","type":"publications"},{"content":"","date":"Aug 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/complexity/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Complexity","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Aug 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/resource-control/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Resource Control","type":"tags"},{"content":"Roberto M.

Our contribution is a system of compositional static analyses to guarantee that each instant terminates and to bound the size of the values computed by the system as a function of the size of its parameters at the beginning of the instant.\nOur method generalises an approach designed for first-order functional languages that relies on a combination of standard termination techniques for term rewriting systems and an analysis of the size of the computed values based on the notion of quasi-interpretation.\nWe show that these two methods can be combined to obtain an explicit polynomial bound on the resources needed for the execution of the system during an instant\nAs a second contribution, we introduce a virtual machine and a related bytecode thus producing a precise description of the resources needed for the execution of a system.

Our size verification method is expressed as a static analysis, performed at the level of the bytecode, that relies on machine-checkable certificates. We follow here the usual assumption that code and certificates may be forged and should be checked before execution.\nOur approach extends a system of static analyses based on the notion of quasi-interpretations that has already been used to enforce resource bounds on first-order functional programs. This paper makes two additional contributions. First, we are able to check optimized programs, containing instructions for unconditional jumps and tail-recursive calls, and remove restrictions on the structure of the bytecode that was imposed in previous works.

Multitrees are extensions of trees with both associative and associative-commutative symbols that may bear arbitrary numbers of sons. An originality of our approach is that transitions of an automaton are restricted using Presburger\u0026rsquo;s constraints. The benefit of this extension is that we generalize, all together, automata with equality and disequalities constraints as well as counting constraints. This new class of automata appears very general as it may encompass hedge automata, a simple yet effective model for XML schemata, feature tree automata, automata with constraints between brothers and automata with arithmetical constraints. Moreover, the class of recognizable languages enjoys all the typical good properties of traditional regular languages: closure under boolean operations and composition by associative and associative-commutative operators, determinisation, decidability of the test for emptiness, \u0026hellip;\nWe apply our automata to query languages for XML-like documents and to automated inductive theorem proving based on rewriting, obtaining each time new results. Using a classical connection between logic and automata, we design a decidable logic for (multi)trees that can be used as a foundation for querying XML-like document. This proposition has the same flavour as a query language for semi-structured recently proposed by Cardelli and Ghelli.

In the region calculus, each boxed value has a statically determined region in which it is stored. Regions are allocated and de-allocated according to a stack discipline, thus improving memory management. The idea of name groups arose in the typed ambient calculus of Cardelli, Ghelli, and Gordon. There, and in our pi-calculus, each name has a statically determined group to which it belongs. Groups allow for type-checking of certain mobility properties, as well as effect analyses. Our encoding makes precise the intuitive correspondence between regions and groups. We propose a new formulation of the type preservation property of the region calculus, which avoids Tofte and Talpin\u0026rsquo;s rather elaborate co-inductive formulation. We prove the encoding preserves the static and dynamic semantics of the region calculus. Our proof of the correctness of region de-allocation shows it to be a specific instance of a general garbage collection principle for the pi-calculus with effects.

In this semantics, an equivalence relation, the spatial congruence, is defined on the top of an unlabelled transition system, the reduction system. Reduction is used to represent a real step of evolution (in time), while spatial congruence is used to identify processes up to particular (spatial) rearrangements.\nIn this paper, we show that it is decidable to check whether two ambient calculus processes are spatially congruent, or not. Our proof is based on a natural and intuitive interpretation of Mobility processes as edge-labelled finite-depth trees. This allows us to concentrate on the subtle interaction between two key operators of the ambient calculus, namely restriction, that accounts for the dynamic generation of new location names, and replication, used to encode recursion. The result of our study is the definition of an algorithm to decide spatial congruence and a definition of a normal form for processes that is useful in the proof of interesting equivalence laws.\nReferences # An extended version of this paper appears as Technical Report MSR-TR-2000-41, Microsoft Research, May 2000. \u0026nbsp;PDF Citation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:spacongdec, author = {{Dal Zilio}, Silvano}, title = {{Spatial Congruence for the Ambients is Decidable}}, booktitle = {ASIAN\u0026#39;00 -- 6th Asian Computing Science Conference}, series = {Lecture Notes in Computer Science}, volume = {1961}, publisher = {Springer-Verlag}, doi = {10.1007/3-540-44464-5_8}, month = nov, year = 2000 } ","date":"Nov 2000","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/spacongdec/","section":"","summary":"Silvano Dal Zilio \u003cbr /\u003e\nIn \u003cem\u003eASIAN'00\u003c/em\u003e ‚Äî \u003cem\u003e6th Asian Computing Science Conference\u003c/em\u003e, nov 2000.","title":"Spatial Congruence for the Ambients is Decidable","type":"publications"},{"content":"Silvano Dal Zilio In IFIP TCS 2000 ‚Äî International Conference on Theoretical Computer Science, aug 2000. conference paper \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;DOI\u0026#12296;10.1007/3-540-44929-9_29\u0026#12297; Abstract # We propose an interpretation of a typed concurrent calculus of objects based on the model of Abadi and Cardelli imperative object calculus.

In the region calculus, each boxed value has a statically determined region in which it is stored. Regions are allocated and de-allocated according to a stack discipline, thus improving memory management. The idea of name groups arose in the typed ambient calculus of Cardelli, Ghelli, and Gordon. There, and in our pi-calculus, each name has a statically determined group to which it belongs. Groups allow for type-checking of certain mobility properties, as well as effect analyses. Our encoding makes precise the intuitive correspondence between regions and groups. We propose a new formulation of the type preservation property of the region calculus, which avoids Tofte and Talpin\u0026rsquo;s rather elaborate co-inductive formulation. We prove the encoding preserves the static and dynamic semantics of the region calculus. Our proof of the correctness of region de-allocation shows it to be a specific instance of a general garbage collection principle for the pi-calculus with effects. We propose new equational laws for letregion, analogous to scope mobility laws in the pi-calculus, and show them sound in our semantics.\nReferences # An extended version of this paper appears as Technical Report MSR-TR-2000-57, Microsoft Research, August 2000. \u0026nbsp;PDF\nAn abridged version appears in the Journal of Functional Programming 12(3):229-292, May 2002. \u0026nbsp;Link\nCitation # @InProceedings{DalzilioS:regions, author = {{Dal Zilio}, Silvano and Gordon, Andrew D.}, title = {{Region analysis and a pi-calculus with groups}}, booktitle = {MFCS 2000 -- 25th International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science}, series = {Lecture Notes in Computer Science}, volume = {1893}, publisher = {Springer-Verlag}, doi = {10.1007/3-540-44612-5_1}, pages = {1--20}, month = aug, year = 2000 } ","date":"Aug 2000","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/regions/","section":"","summary":"Silvano Dal Zilio, Andrew D.

PhD \u0026nbsp;PDF Abstract # The blue calculus, defined by Boudol, is a variant of the polyadic pi-calculus that directly embeds the notion of function. In this thesis, we define a version of the blue calculus, extended with records, and we study whether it provides a good basis for a typed concurrent programming language with imperative, higher-order, and object features. We notably study the modeling of the functional and object oriented programming idioms, and the addition of polymorphic typing and inheritance.\nThe thesis is divided into four parts. The first part consists of a detailed analysis of the blue calculus and its expressiveness. In the second part, we define a behavioral equivalence based on the classical notion of barbed congruence, and a labeled bisimulation that is finer than this congruence. We then use up-to proof techniques to prove the validity of several algebraic laws like, for example, an analogous of Milner\u0026rsquo;s replication theorem for the pi-calculus.\nIn the third part, we study type systems for the blue calculus. Starting from a simple implicit type system that encompasses both Curry\u0026rsquo;s type system for the lambda-calculus, and Milner\u0026rsquo;s sorting for the pi-calculus, we successively propose three extensions of increasing complexity. We study the addition of subtyping, then parametric polymorphism. In this last case, we also study the decidability of the type inference problem. Finally, we study an higher-order type system with recursion and a particular form of bounded universal quantification. This system, that is suitable for the typing of objects, can be intuitively viewed as a Curry style presentation of F-sub. We prove the soundness of this system.\nThe last part of the thesis is devoted to the study of objects in the blue calculus. We give a typed interpretation of two popular object calculi, namely Abadi-Cardelli\u0026rsquo;s object calculus ‚Äî in its functional version, and in its concurrent version ‚Äî, and the calculus of extensible objects defined by Fisher and Mitchell. Our main contribution is a typed interpretation of the calculus of extensible objects that preserves subtyping.\nCitation # @PhdThesis{DalzilioS:these, author = {{Dal Zilio}, Silvano}, title = {{Le calcul bleu: types et objets}}, school = {Universit√© de Nice - Sophia-Antipolis}, year = 1999 } ","date":"Jul 1999","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/publications/these/","section":"","summary":"Silvano Dal Zilio \u003cbr /\u003e\nPhD thesis, Universit√© de Nice - Sophia-Antipolis, jul 1999.","title":"Le calcul bleu: types et objets","type":"publications"},{"content":"Silvano Dal Zilio Research Report 3664, INRIA, apr 1999. technical report \u0026nbsp;PDF \u0026nbsp;HAL-00073008 Abstract # The Blue calculus is a direct extension of both the lambda and the pi calculi.
