__main architect:__ Bernard Berthomieu

The TINA toolbox is a set of tools for the
edition and analysis of time Petri Nets and their extensions. In particular it
can handle Time Petri Nets (TPN), priorities, inhibitor arcs, and an extension
of TPN with _data handling_ called TTS.

Tina includes an editor and GUI (`nd`) for Time Petri Nets and Automata; stepper
simulators and state space generation tools (`tina` and `sift`); structural
analysis tools (`struct`); and model-checkers for state/event LTL (`selt`), and for
CTL* and an existential fragment of &mu; calculus (`muse`).

`sift` is a specialized version of `tina` supporting in addition on the fly
verification of reachability properties. If offers less options than `tina` but
is typically faster and requires considerably less space.
