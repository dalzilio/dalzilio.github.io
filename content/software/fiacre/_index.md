__main architect:__ Bernard Berthomieu
 
FIACRE is an _Intermediate Formal language for the description of
concurrent activities with real-time constraints._ 

It is a formally defined language for representing compositionaly both the
behavioral and timing aspects of embedded and distributed systems for formal
verification and simulation purposes. We provide a compiler (`frac`) that is
able to generate a TTS model from a given Fiacre specification. This TTS model
can then be used with Tina. 

We have recently extended the language with: native
functions and real-time verification patterns, that is a possibility to define
timed temporal properties directly within a specification. """
