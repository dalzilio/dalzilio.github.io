__main architect:__ Silvano Dal Zilio

Twina a tool for analyzing the “product” of two Time Petri Nets (TPN), with
possibly inhibitor and read arcs. Its main objective is to compute a usable
representation of the intersection of two net languages; meaning the
intersection of the (timed) languages obtained from the executions of two TPN,
in which transitions with the same labels are fired at the same date"""
