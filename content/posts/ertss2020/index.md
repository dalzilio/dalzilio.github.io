Our paper on the formal verification of autonomy in earth observation
satellites has been accepted at the 10th International Congress and Exhibition
on Embedded Real-Time Software and Systems (ERTSS 2020).

This paper received the best paper award in the category "Autonomous and
Connected Systems"

This work describes a new software architecture allowing to increase the
degree of autonomy in satellites. The main idea is to allow satellites to
modify, in flight, part of their mission plan. This approach is based on the
design of a formally proven mechanism, much like some kind of bytecode verifier,
which ensures the safety of generated plans. You can find more by looking
directly at the paper:
