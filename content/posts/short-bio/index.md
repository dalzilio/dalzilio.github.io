I was born in France in 1971. I obtained my PhD from INRIA and the University of
Nice - Sophia Antipolis in 1999, and I hold a Master's Degree in computer
science from École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, where I studied _parallel
programming and architecture_. In 1993, I worked for one year on developing
vision and learning algorithms for a smart retina for the French ministry of
defence, then joined INRIA Sophia Antipolis for a PhD thesis on using mobile
process calculi as a programming model.

In 1999, I joined the Programming Principles and Tools Group at Microsoft
Research in Cambridge (UK) for two years. In 2001, I became a CNRS researcher,
working at the Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale (LIF) in Marseille, and a
member of the INRIA project MIMOSA. Since July 2007, I am a CNRS researcher at
LAAS in Toulouse.
