Our tool, [TINA](http://projects.laas.fr/tina/software.php), won a gold medal in
the "state space" category of the [Model-Checking Contest
2020](https://mcc.lip6.fr/), an international competition of model-checking
tools for the verification of concurrent systems. This is the second year in a
row that TINA came first in the "state space" category.
