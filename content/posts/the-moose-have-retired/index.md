For the last 20 years, I have been developing my own "static site generators" in
order to create pages for my personal website. Static site generator [have many
benefits](https://gohugo.io/about/benefits/) when compared to Content Management
Systems, especially in terms of security, but also because they are generally
more "low maintenance". Did I tell you that the last edit on my pages were in
December 2015.

Developing your own site generator  is also the occasion to play with new
technologies, or at least technologies that I do not have to use in my work. One
of the best example may be the original system that I developed in 1997 for
generating my (HTML) bibliography pages from a BibTeX file. It was based on a
specially crafted .bst file, written in a postfix stack language, mixing
elements from Pascal and Postscript.

After working on my own DSL (for content description) and Perl (for page
generation) for almost 10 years, the last iteration of my web site was based on
the use of XML and XSLT. This was a good side-project at a time when I was in
charge of teaching XML technologies at Universit√© de Provence.

Nevertheless, Web technologies have become more and more complex, and it is
simply not possible to keep the pace with new evolutions in front-end
development. One example could be the need to develop accessible websites; use
responsive pages; rely on a flexible grid layout; ...

This is the reason why my new site relies on the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site
generators and the [Hugo Academic
theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic). Let us hope this solution will
stay stable for the next 10 years.

As for the title of this post, it is a nod to the [Calculi for Mobile
Processes](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/mobility/) pages. Go see the
[moose](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/mobility/moose.html); they have been retired for
quite some time now.
