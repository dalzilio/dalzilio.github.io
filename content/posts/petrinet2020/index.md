A tool paper about [MCC](https://github.com/dalzilio/mcc)---our software for
transformings models of High-Level Petri nets, given in PNML, into equivalent
Place/Transition nets, not the competition!---has been accepted at Petri Nets
2020. You can find more about it here:

Like many conferences this year, Petri Nets happened as a virtual event, with
prerecorded videos of the talks, including a short (3 minutes) *teaser video* to
introduce each paper. You can find these videos on the official YouTube channel
for the conference, including a *tool demonstration video*.

The videos for MCC won several awards this year, so I strongly suggest that you
go and watch them ;-)
