SPICES stands for _Support for Predictable Integration of mission Critical
Embedded Systems_. SPICES is an EUREKA-ITEA project and ran from 01/09/2006
until 31/08/2009. The SPICES project gathers European (France, Spain, Belgium)
partners involved in the domain of mission critical embedded system engineering.
The consortium is engaged in the provision of an engineering process supported
by tools and software frameworks, emphasising the predictability of integration
of real-time and embedded systems that may be the subject to certification
constraints.

The aim of the SPICES project is: The proposal of a 'reconciled' aproach, by
means of new methods and tools to derive from extended AADL descriptions,
component-based predictable implementations of mission-critical embedded systems
associated with certification issues. We will extend this ADL (architecture
description language) to support specific non-functional real-time embedded
constraints and to provide run-time execution capabilities.

The project has adopted and contributes to two open technology standards: AADL
(Architecture Analysis & Design Language, an SAE standard) on one hand, and
Lightweight-CCM (a real-time embedded component-oriented software platform, an
OMG standard).

It relies on new and state of the art analysis and verification techniques, and
ensures the necessary links of software artefacts with models. It examines the
adoption of a tool-based process in front of certification constraints.

It will provide in-depth evaluation and experience-reports on the use of project
tools and guidelines, thanks to the realisation of demonstrators in the
Avionics, Space and Communications domains.
