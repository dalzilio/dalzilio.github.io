&ldquo;_In a perfect world, models would always be correct and verification
tools would answer all our questions. In the Daedalus project, we are preparing
for an imperfect world._&rdquo;

Daedalus (__Debugging Architecture Description Languages__ ) is a project funded
by RTRA STAE. Its main objective is to bridge the gap between: (1) automatic
generation of code that is _correct by construction_; and (2) automatic
verification of behavioral models."""

The Daedalus project is part of a larger initiative on the _formal system
engineering_ for embedded systems. The project seeks to help designers get out
of the "labyrinth of current technologies" in two major areas of research:

* automatic code generation; and

* model checking and (semi-formal) debugging of behavioral model.

We seek to develop new ways of using formal methods during system design
(through _formal debugging_ of architecture and behavioral models) and to take
benefit from the use of a "more synchronous" execution model.

This basic research project is, at the moment, more focused on the Aeronautics
and Space domains. This is what motivated our choice of choosing the AADL
architecture description language as a pivot in our prototyping activities.
