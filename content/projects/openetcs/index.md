Excerpt from the [openETCS website](http://openetcs.org/about/).

openETCS is a project, not an organisation. The goal of the project is an “Open
Proof” for the European Train Control System.

## The Context

Europe’s railways have developed over the last 150 years within national
boundaries, resulting in a variety of different signalling and train control
systems, which hampers cross-border traffic. The European Union has decided to
improve interoperability for the railway sector. Therefore the European Train
Control System (ETCS) as part of the European Rail Traffic Management System
(ERTMS) is intended to replace almost all national legacy mainline signalling
and train control systems all across Europe. ETCS consists of infrastructure
components and on-board units (OBU). A System Requirement Specification (SRS,
actual Version: 2.3.0d) has been cooperatively created mainly by 6 major
European railway signalling manufacturers. Those firms have formed an
association, called UNISIG to manage and coordinate these activities in close
cooperation with the EU Commission and the bodies of railway operators.
Beginning with the 3rd version of the SRS, this document has been published by
the European Railway Agency (ERA), therefore in the“public domain” and will be
mandatory by 2015 for all new infrastructure and train borne signalling and
train control equipment.

Especially for the on-board part of the ETCS equipment the degree of functional
complexity to be implemented has turned out to be significantly higher than in
conventional signalling and train control systems, thus resulting in significant
cost increases for software development, homologation and maintenance. This has
caused a cost level for the operators, which is by a factor of 3 to 10 times
higher compared with conventional national onboard systems at the same overall
performance level.

## The Goals and major expected outcomes

The purpose of the openETCS project is to develop an integrated modelling,
development, validation and testing framework for leveraging the cost-efficient
and reliable implementation of ETCS. The framework will provide a holistic tool
chain across the whole development process of ETCS software. The tool chain will
support the formal specification and verification of the ETCS system
requirements, the automatic and ETCS compliant code generation and validation,
and the model-based test case generation and execution. openETCS will utilize
“Open Standards” on all levels, including hardware and software specifica­tion,
interface definition, design tools, verification and validation procedures and
last but not least embedded control software. By applying those technologies and
related business concepts a significant cost cut for the final onboard product
is expected down to or even below conventional high performance cab signalling
systems (e.g. LZB Linien-Zug-Beeinflussung, as used in Germany, Austria and
Spain). The open source concept provides for a neutral and formal method based
“correct” functioning reference device that will help to overcome existing
interoperability problems, supporting manufacturers, infrastructure managers and
railway undertakings alike, avoiding exhaustive field tests, transferring
verification and validation activities from the track site into laboratories,
saving scarce resources and finally accelerating the migration phase and
therefore supporting the European ERTMS deployment plan.
