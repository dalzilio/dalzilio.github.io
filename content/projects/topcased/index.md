The TOPCASED project aims at developing an open source CASE environment for
critical applications and systems development. Its main benefits should be to
perpetuate the methods and tools for software development, minimize ownership
costs, ensure independence of development platform, integrate, as soon as
possible, methodological changes and advances made in academic world, be able to
adapt tools to the process instead of the opposite, take into account
qualification constraints.

One key point is that TOPCASED focuses on critical system development, which
means that a strong emphasis is made on system validation and on traceability.

Topcased was followed by the __OpenEmbeDD__ project (Model Driven Engineering
open-source platform for Real-Time and Embedded systems), is an initiative for
an open-source embedded system design toolchain based on Eclipse (funded by
RNTL, from 2006 to 2009). Today, development are part of the
[PolarSys](https://www.polarsys.org/) Eclipse WP.
