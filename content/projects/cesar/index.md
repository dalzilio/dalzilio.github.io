"CESAR" stands for Cost-efficient methods and processes for safety relevant
embedded systems and is a European funded project from ARTEMIS JOINT UNDERTAKING
(JU).

The three transportation domains automotive, aerospace, and rail, as well as the
automation domain share the need to develop ultra-reliable embedded systems to
meet societal demands for increased mobility and ensuring safety in a highly
competitive global market.

To maintain the European leading edge position in the transportation as well as
automation market, CESAR aims to boost cost efficiency of embedded systems
development and safety and certification processes by an order of magnitude.

CESAR pursuits a multi-domain approach integrating large enterprises, suppliers,
SME's and vendors of cross sectoral domains and cooperating with leading
research organizations and innovative SME's.

## Abstract

The embedded safety-critical systems design and development industry is facing
increasing complexity and variety of systems and devices, coupled with
increasing regulatory constraints while costs, performances and time to market
are constantly challenged.

This has led to a profusion of enablers (new processes, methods and tools),
which are neither integrated nor interoperable because they have been developed
more or less independently, addressing only a part of the complexity issue, such
as safety. The absence of internationally recognized open standards is a
limiting factor in terms of industrial performance when companies have to select
among these enablers.

CESAR will bring significant and conclusive innovations in the two most
improvable systems engineering disciplines:

* Requirements engineering in particular through formalization of multi
   viewpoint, multi criteria and multi level requirements,

* Component based engineering applied to design space exploration comprising
   multi-view, multi-criteria and multi level architecture trade-offs.

Multi-viewpoint based development processes assure that not only functional
aspects but also safety, costs, robustness, timeliness, etc. are captured and
documented in a form allowing validation and verification to be performed.
Multi-criteria based design processes allow for optimization of designs to
multiple objectives functions for such extra-functional characteristics of
designs, a key for achieving competitive products. Multi-level design flows
cover all stages from initial concepts through requirements through
specification to design and implementation, typically crossing multiple stages
in supplier chains. The combination of these aspects will allow movement towards
"first-time-right" designs, where the actual integration phases are free of
negative surprises.

In addition, CESAR intends to provide industrial companies with a breakthrough
in system development by deploying a customizable systems engineering "Reference
Technology Platform" (RTP) making it possible to integrate or interoperate
existing or emerging available technologies. This will be a significant step
forward in terms of industrial performance improvement that will help to
establish de-facto standards and contribute to the standardization effort from a
European perspective. Relying on use-cases and scenarios from Aerospace,
Automotive, Automation and Railway, CESAR is strongly industry driven.
Benefiting from this multi-domains point of views, CESAR addresses safety
aspects of transportation and other societal mobility and environmental demands.
