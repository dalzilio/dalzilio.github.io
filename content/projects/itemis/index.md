ITEmIS (_Integrated Embedded Systems and Information Systems_) is a project
funded by ANR. The goal of the project is to define an abstract reference system
architecture, a methodology, and a set of algorithms (transformed into tools,
mechanisms, protocols and correctness verification algorithms) for realizing
large systems of systems, integrating multiple levels, from information systems
to mobile, embedded systems.

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), as a key architectural pattern for prompt
and rapid integration, is today a cornerstone of the agile Information
Technology (IT) wave. Indeed, although SOA may sometimes be felt as just one
more buzzword, it must be kept in mind that most of today's greatest successes,
in terms of bringing agility to the whole enterprise through its IT backbone,
have been provided by SOA and its major technological counterparts that are the
Web Services and the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). In this field, agility must
be understood as "the combination of speed and adaptability: speed to bring new
solutions to market more quickly, and adaptability to new business requirements
and competitive pressure".

At the same time, large control and command systems are envisaged, which may
roughly be described as net- centric assemblies of heterogeneous lightweight
sensors and actuators along with several large control systems. To accomplish
such systems, there is currently a strong need of techniques at the cutting edge
of technology that could bring seamless integration and deployment of
lightweight embedded applications and IT services in a global agile system of
services. In this context, ITEmIS aims at easing the evolution from today's
world of separate lightweight embedded applications and IT services to the
future world of seamlessly integrated services, thus qualifying and defining a
new generation SOA enabling IT and Embedded Integrated Systems (ITEmIS systems).
This endeavour is undertaken along three main lines:

1. At business level, where IT/embedded services are integrated into advanced
   workflows supporting the multi-faceted interoperability and scalability
   required for ITEmIS systems;

2. At service infrastructure level, by introducing a specialized ESB-based and
   component-based solution addressing the requirements of the embedded world
   including deployment; and

3. Transversally for both above levels addressing end-to-end assurance of
   Quality of Service (QoS) and correctness verification of deployments and
   workflows at the level of their execution models.

To tackle these three aspects, ITEmIS provides: a service-oriented middleware
achieving deployment, run-time integration, and administration of the
heterogeneous IT/embedded services into ITEmIS systems; and Model Driven
Engineering (MDE)-based meta-models and tools for the modelling, development,
deployment, administration and correctness verification of IT/embedded services
and ITEmIS systems. ITEmIS goals towards enabling ITEmIS systems are highly
challenging due to their special requirements deriving from the extreme
heterogeneity of their constituent IT/embedded systems and their increased need
for scalability and agility.

Overall, ITEmIS aims at establishing an abstract reference system architecture,
a methodology, and a set of algorithms (transformed into tools, mechanisms,
protocols and correctness verification algorithms) for realizing ITEmIS systems.
Due to its nature and objectives, ITEmIS should not be technology-specific and
should enable integrating any new technology into the ITEmIS architecture.
Nevertheless, in order to ensure proper exploitation opportunities, ITEmIS has a
strong commitment in reusing today's state-of-the-art standard technologies
concerning the ESB infrastructure, the MDE/component-based design and
development tooling, and the embedded-oriented lightweight component
technologies.
