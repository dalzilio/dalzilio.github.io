I am a senior researcher at [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr), in Toulouse. My
research interests include the _formal verification_ of concurrent and
distributed systems; methods and tools for checking the safety of critical
embedded systems; concurrency semantics, and in particular mobile and
higher-order process calculi; as well as type systems and static analysis.

I am now part of the [TRUST research
team](https://www.laas.fr/public/en/teams/trust/) (for _Trustworthy systems:
foundations and practices_), where I most particularly develop new verification
methods and tools for checking properties of critical systems having strong
temporal and timing requirements.

## Research Interests

- Formal Methods and their [applications](/tags/use-case) (e.g. for
  [security](/tags/security), [robotics](/tags/robotics),
  [diagnosability](/tags/diagnosability), ...)

- Model-Checking and [Formal Verification](/tags/verification), as well as the
  implementation of related [software tools](/tags/tools)

- [Petri nets](/tags/petri) and their [timed extensions](/tags/time-petri-nets)

- [Safety Critical Embedded Systems](/tags/safety), and [Architectural
  languages](/tags/architecture-languages) for their use in [Model-Based System
  Engineering](/tags/system-engineering)

- Process Calculi and [Concurrency Semantics](/tags/concurrency) ([pi
  calculus](/tags/pi-calculus), [mobile ambients](/tags/mobile-ambients), ...)
