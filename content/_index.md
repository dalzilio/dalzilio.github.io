I am a senior researcher at [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr), in Toulouse. My
research interests include the _formal verification_ of concurrent and
distributed systems; methods and tools for checking the safety of critical
embedded systems; concurrency semantics, and in particular mobile and
higher-order process calculi; as well as type systems and static analysis.

I am now part of the [TRUST research
team](https://www.laas.fr/public/en/teams/trust/) (for _Trustworthy systems:
foundations and practices_), where I most particularly develop new verification
methods and tools for checking properties of critical systems having strong
temporal and timing requirements.

## Interests

- Formal Methods
- Model-Checking
- Safety Critical Embedded Systems
- Time Petri nets
- Process Calculi
