For the rest of the course we will be using the tool Tina to edit and analyze
Petri nets, see <http://projects.laas.fr/tina/>.

## Exercise 1. Modelling

Remember the message-passing example?

{{< figure src="../files/msg.png">}}

1. Create the model in Tina using the NetDraw editor (nd)

2. Add the possibility to lose a message when going left-to-right (place p4)

3. Add the possibility to re-emit the message if it was lost

## Exercise 2. Pre- and Post-conditions

Write the (Pre,Post) conditions for the following P/T net

{{< figure src="../files/post.png">}}

{{< katex >}}

$$A= \left (
\begin{bmatrix}
 \dots \\\\\\
 \dots
\end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix}
 \dots \\\\\\
 \dots
\end{bmatrix} \right )
\\qquad
B= \left (
\begin{bmatrix}
 2 \\\\\\
 1
\end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix}
 0 \\\\\\
 3
\end{bmatrix} \right )
\\qquad
C= \left (
\begin{bmatrix}
 \dots \\\\\\
 \dots
\end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix}
 \dots \\\\\\
 \dots
\end{bmatrix} \right )$$

$$m_0= \begin{bmatrix}
 4 \\\\\\
 2
\end{bmatrix} = X.4, Y.2$$

Always on the same example:

1. Compute the marking graph.

2. Define the trace language for this net.

3. Draw the net with the editor.

4. Build the marking graph (Tools > reachability), first in verbose mode then in
  aut format, and check whether you were correct.

5. Find a (good!) reason why this net will always be bounded (\\(\forall ùëö_0\\)).

6. In general, this property depends on the value of \\(ùëö_0\\). Find an example
  of P/T net that has a finite marking graph on some inputs and not one others.

## Exercise 3.  The printer queue

John wants to print a file. He needs to grab access to the (shared) printer, TP,
then to the printer queue, TQ, before releasing, R, the two resources.

{{< figure src="../files/printer.png">}}

1. Draw the net with the editor.

2. Simulate the behavior (Tools > stepper).

3. Model a second user, Fred, that takes the same resources, but in the other order.

4. ‚ÄúMerge‚Äù the two nets.

5. Simulate the behavior (Tools > stepper).

6. Build the marking graph (Tools > reachability), first in verbose mode then in aut format.

## Exercise 4.  The swimming pool

Model the operations in a swimming pool

* A swimming pool has \\(c\\) cabins, where people can undress, and \\(p\\) baskets to deposit clothes.

* A user can enter a cabin (TC) only if a cabin is free.

* Once he has a cabin, he has to wait to take a basket (TB) to change and deposit his clothes.

* Then it releases the cabin and enter the swimming pool (ES).

* He can leave the basin (LS) only if a cabin is free.

* After changing, he leaves his basket (LB) and frees a cabin.

* Finally, he exits (EXIT) the pool.
