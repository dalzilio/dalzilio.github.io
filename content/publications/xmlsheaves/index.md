## Abstract
XML documents, and other forms of semi-structured data, may be roughly described as edge
        labeled trees; it is therefore natural to use tree automata to reason on them. This idea has
        already been successfully applied in the context of _Document Type Definition_ (DTD), the
        simplest standard for defining XML documents validity, but additional work is needed to take
        into account XML Schema, a more advanced standard, for which regular tree automata are not
        satisfactory. In this paper, we define a tree logic that directly embeds XML Schema as a
        plain subset as well as a new class of automata for unranked trees, used to decide this
        logic, which is well-suited to the processing of XML documents and schemas.
