## Abstract
We propose an interpretation of a typed concurrent calculus of objects based on the model
        of Abadi and Cardelli imperative object calculus. The target of our interpretation is a
        version of the blue calculus, a variant of the pi-calculus that directly contains the lambda
        calculus, with record and first-order types. We show that reduction and type judgments can
        be derived in a rather simple and natural way, and that our encoding can be extended to
        self-types and synchronization primitives. We also prove some equational laws on objects.
