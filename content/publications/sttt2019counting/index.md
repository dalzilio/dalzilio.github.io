## Abstract
We propose a method to count the number of reachable markings of a Petri net without having
        to enumerate these first. The method relies on a structural reduction system that reduces
        the number of places and transitions of the net in such a way that we can faithfully compute
        the number of reachable markings of the original net from the reduced net and the reduction
        history. The method has been implemented, and computing experiments show that reductions are
        effective on a large benchmark of models.
