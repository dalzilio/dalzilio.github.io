## Abstract
We provide a translation of Fisher-Honsell-Mitchell's delegation-based object calculus with
        subtyping into a lambda-calculus with extensible records. The target type system is an
        extension of the system Fω of dependent types with recursion, extensible records and a
        form of bounded universal quantification. We show that our translation is computationally
        adequate, that the typing rules of Fisher-Honsell-Mitchell's calculus can be derived in a
        rather simple and natural way, and that our system enjoys the standard subject reduction
        property.
