## Abstract
The Blue Calculus is a direct extension of both the lambda and the pi calculi. In a
        preliminary work from GÃ©rard Boudol, a simple type system was given that incorporates
        Curry's type inference for the lambda-calculus. In the present paper we study an implicit
        polymorphic type system, adapted from the ML typing discipline. Our typing system enjoys
        subject reduction and principal type properties and we give results on the complexity for
        the type inference problem. These are interesting results for the blue calculus as a
        programming notation for higher-order concurrency.
