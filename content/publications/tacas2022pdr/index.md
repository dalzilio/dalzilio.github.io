## Abstract
We propose a semi-decision procedure for checking generalized reachability properties, on
        generalized Petri nets, that is based on the Property Directed Reachability (PDR) method. We
        actually define three different versions, that vary depending on the method used for
        abstracting possible witnesses, and that are able to handle problems of increasing
        difficulty. We have implemented our methods in a model-checker called SMPT and give
        empirical evidences that our approach can handle problems that are difficult or impossible
        to check with current state of the art tools.
