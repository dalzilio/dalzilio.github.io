## Abstract
SMPT (for Satisfiability Modulo Petri Net) is a model checker for reachability problems in
        Petri nets. It started as a portfolio of methods to experiment with symbolic model checking,
        and was designed to be easily extended. Some distinctive features are its ability to benefit
        from structural reductions and to generate verdict certificates. Our tool is quite mature
        and performed well compared to other state-of-the-art tools in the Model Checking Contest.
