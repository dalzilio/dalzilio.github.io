## Abstract
We present a methodology to learn how to recognize binary shapes, based on the principle
        that recognition may be understood as a process of information compression. Our approach,
        directed towards adaptive target tracking applications, is intended to be well suited to
        fine-grained parallel architectures, such as cellular automata machines that can be
        integrated in artificial retinas. This methodology, fruitfully explained within the frame of
        mathematical morphology, is then particularized in the perspective of its actual
        implementation.
