## Abstract
The design of embedded real-time systems requires specific toolchains to guarantee time
        constraints and safe behavior. These tools and their artifacts need to be managed in a
        coherent way all along the design process and need to address timing constraints and
        execution semantic in a holistic way during the system’s modeling, verification, and
        implementation phases. However, modeling languages used by these tools do not always share a
        common semantic. This can introduce a dangerous gap between what designers want to express,
        what is verified and the behavior of the final executable code. In order to address this
        problem, we propose a new toolchain, called Hippo, that integrates tools for design,
        verification and execution built around a common formalism.
