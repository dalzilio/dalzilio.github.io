## Abstract
We present our ongoing research on the extension of the Fiacre language with real-time
        constructs and real-time verification patterns. Fiacre is a formal language with support for
        expressing concurrency and timing constraints; its goal is to act as an intermediate format
        for the formal verification of high-level modeling language, such as Architecture
        Description Languages or UML proﬁles for system modeling. Essentially, Fiacre is designed
        both as the target of model transformation engines from various languages, as well as the
        source language of compilers into verification toolboxes, namely Tina and CADP. Our
        motivations for extending Fiacre are to reduce the semantic gap between Fiacre and
        high-level description languages and to streamline our verification process.
