## Abstract
We describe _multitree automata_ and a related logic on multitrees. Multitrees are
        extensions of trees with both associative and associative-commutative symbols that may bear
        arbitrary numbers of sons. An originality of our approach is that transitions of an
        automaton are restricted using Presburger's constraints. The benefit of this extension is
        that we generalize, all together, automata with equality and disequalities constraints as
        well as counting constraints. This new class of automata appears very general as it may
        encompass hedge automata, a simple yet effective model for XML schemata, feature tree
        automata, automata with constraints between brothers and automata with arithmetical
        constraints. Moreover, the class of recognizable languages enjoys all the typical good
        properties of traditional regular languages: closure under boolean operations and
        composition by associative and associative-commutative operators, determinisation,
        decidability of the test for emptiness, ... 

We apply our automata to query languages for XML-like documents and to automated inductive
        theorem proving based on rewriting, obtaining each time new results. Using a classical
        connection between logic and automata, we design a decidable logic for (multi)trees that can
        be used as a foundation for querying XML-like document. This proposition has the same
        flavour as a query language for semi-structured recently proposed by Cardelli and Ghelli.
        The same tree logic is used to yield decidable cases of inductive reducibility modulo
        associativity-commutativity, a key property in inductive theorem proving based on rewriting.
