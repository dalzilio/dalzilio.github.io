## Abstract
In this paper, we propose an approach for analyzing and validating a composition of
        services with respect to real time properties. We consider services defined using an
        extension of the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) where timing constraints can be
        associated to the execution of an activity or define delays between events. The goal is to
        check whether a choreography of timed services satisfies given complex real time
        requirements. Our approach is based on a formal interpretation of timed choreographies in
        the Fiacre verification language that defines a precise model for the behavior of services
        and their timed interactions. We also rely on a logic-based language for property definition
        to formalize complex real-time requirements and on specific tooling for model-checking
        Fiacre specifications.
