## Abstract
This paper details works undertaken in the scope of the Spices project concerning the
        behavioral verification of AADL models. We give a high-level view of the tools involved and
        describe the successive transformations performed by our verification process. We also
        report on an experiment carried out in order to evaluate our framework and give the first
        experimental results obtained on real-size models. This demonstrator models a network
        protocol in charge of data communications between an airplane and ground stations. From this
        study we draw a set of conclusions about the integration of model-checking tools in an
        industrial development process.
