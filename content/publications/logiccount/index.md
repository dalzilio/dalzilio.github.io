## Abstract
We prove the decidability of the quantifier-free, static fragment of ambient logic, with
        composition adjunct and iteration, which corresponds to a kind of regular expression
        language for semistructured data. The essence of this result is a surprising connection
        between formulas of the ambient logic and counting constraints on (nested) vectors of
        integers.

Our proof method is based on a new class of tree automata for unranked, unordered trees,
        which may result in practical algorithms for deciding the satisfiability of a formula. A
        benefit of our approach is to naturally lead to an extension of the logic with recursive
        definitions, which is also decidable. Finally, we identify a simple syntactic restriction on
        formulas that improves the effectiveness of our algorithms on large examples.
