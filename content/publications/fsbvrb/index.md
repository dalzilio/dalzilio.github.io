## Abstract
We define a simple stack machine for a first-order functional language and show how to
        perform type, size, and termination verifications at the level of the bytecode of the
        machine. In particular, we show that a combination of size verification based on
        quasi-interpretations and of termination verification based on lexicographic path orders
        leads to an explicit bound on the space required for the execution.
