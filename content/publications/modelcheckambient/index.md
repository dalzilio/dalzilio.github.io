## Abstract
We settle the complexity bounds of the model checking problem for the ambient calculus with
        public names against the ambient logic. We show that if either the calculus contains
        replication or the logic contains the guarantee operator, the problem is undecidable. In the
        case of the replication-free calculus and guarantee-free logic we prove that the problem is
        PSPACE-complete. For the complexity upper bound, we devise a new representation of processes
        that remains of polynomial size during process execution; this allows us to keep the model
        checking procedure in polynomial space. Moreover, we prove PSPACE-hardness of the problem
        for several quite simple fragments of the calculus and the logic; this suggests that there
        are no interesting fragments with polynomial-time model checking algorithms.
