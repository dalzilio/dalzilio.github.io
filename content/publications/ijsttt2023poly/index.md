## Abstract
We propose a new method that takes advantage of structural reductions to accelerate the
        verification of reachability properties on Petri nets. Our approach relies on a state space
        abstraction, called polyhedral abstraction, which involves a combination between structural
        reductions and sets of linear arithmetic constraints between the marking of places. We
        propose a new data structure, called a Token Flow Graph (TFG), that captures the particular
        structure of constraints occurring in polyhedral abstractions. We leverage TFGs to
        efficiently solve two reachability problems: first to check the reachability of a given
        marking and then to compute the concurrency relation of a net, that is, all pairs of places
        that can be marked together in some reachable marking. Our algorithms are implemented in a
        tool, called Kong, that we evaluate on a large collection of models used during the 2020
        edition of the Model Checking Contest. Our experiments show that the approach works well,
        even when a moderate amount of reductions applies.
