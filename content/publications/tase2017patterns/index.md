## Abstract
To ease the expression of real-time requirements, Dwyer, and then Konrad, studied a large
        collection of existing systems in order to identify a set of real-time property patterns
        covering most of the useful use cases. The goal was to provide a set of reusable patterns
        that system designers can instantiate to express requirements instead of using complex
        temporal logic formulas. A limitation of this approach is that the choice of patterns is
        more oriented towards expressiveness than efficiency; meaning that it does not take into
        account the computational complexity of checking patterns. For this purpose, we define a set
        of verification-dedicated, atomic property patterns for qualitative and quantitative
        real-time requirements. End-user requirements can then be expressed as a composition of
        these patterns using a predefined meta-model and a mapping library. These properties can be
        checked efficiently using a set of elementary observers and a model checking approach.
