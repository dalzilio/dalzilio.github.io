## Abstract
We propose a new method for computing the language intersection of two Time Petri nets
        (TPN); that is the sequence of labels in timed traces common to the execution of two TPN.
        Our approach is based on a new product construction between nets and relies on the State
        Class construction, a widely used method for checking the behaviour of TPN. We prove that
        this new construct does not add additional expressive power, and yet that it can lead to
        very concise representation of the result. We have implemented our approach in a new tool,
        called Twina. We report on some experimental results obtained with this tool and show how to
        apply our approach on two interesting problems: first, to define an equivalent of the
        twin-plant diagnosability methods for TPN; then as a way to check timed properties without
        interfering with a system.
