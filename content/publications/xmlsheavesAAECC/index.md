## Abstract
XML documents may be roughly described as unranked, ordered trees and it is therefore
        natural to use tree automata to process or validate them. This idea has already been
        successfully applied in the context of Document Type Definition (DTD), the simplest standard
        for defining document validity, but additional work is needed to take into account XML
        Schema, a more advanced standard, for which regular tree automata are not satisfactory. In
        this paper, we introduce Sheaves Logic (SL), a new tree logic that extends the syntax of the
        (recursion-free fragment of) W3C XML Schema Definition Language (WXS). Then, we define a new
        class of automata for unranked trees that provides decision procedures for the basic
        questions about SL: model-checking; satisfiability; entailment. The same class of automata
        is also used to answer basic questions about WXS, including recursive schemas: decidability
        of type-checking documents; testing the emptiness of schemas; testing that a schema subsumes
        another one.
