## Abstract
We study the problems related to querying large, distributed XML documents. Our proposal
        takes the form of a new process calculus in which XML data are processes that can be queried
        by means of concurrent pattern-matching expressions. What we achieve is a functional,
        strongly-typed programming model based on three main ingredients: an asynchronous process
        calculus in the style of Milner's pi-calculus and existing semantics for concurrent-ML; a
        model where documents and expressions are both represented as processes, and where
        evaluation is represented as a parallel composition of the two; a static type system based
        on regular expression types.
