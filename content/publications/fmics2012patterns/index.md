## Abstract
An issue limiting the adoption of model checking technologies by the industry is the
        ability, for non-experts, to express their requirements using the property languages
        supported by verification tools. This has motivated the definition of dedicated assertion
        languages for expressing temporal properties at a higher level. However, only a limited
        number of these formalisms support the definition of timing constraints. In this paper, we
        propose a set of specification patterns that can be used to express real-time requirements
        commonly found in the design of reactive systems. We also provide an integrated model
        checking tool chain for the verification of timed requirements on TTS, an extension of Timed
        Petri Nets with data variables and priorities.
