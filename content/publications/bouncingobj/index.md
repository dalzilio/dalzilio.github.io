## Abstract
In this paper, we study a model of migrating objects based on the blue calculus, extended
        with a very simple system of localities. We show how two migration behaviors can be defined,
        namely those of bouncing and quiet objects. These migration control abstractions are defined
        separately from other aspects of the object definition and can be easily reused, thus
        providing more flexibility in the definition of migration constraints.
