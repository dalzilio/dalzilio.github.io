## Abstract
Diagnosability is a basic property of Discrete Event Systems that relates to the
        observability of concealed events. Basically, it means that every failure (a distinct
        instance of unobservable event) can be eventually detected after a finite number of
        observations. In this work, we are interested by the diagnosability of systems modelled
        using labelled Time Petri nets (TPN), an extension of Petri nets in which we can associate
        timing constraints to transitions. This means that we take into account the date at which
        events are observed and that we want to detect failures in a bounded time. We are also
        interested by the detection of patterns of events (sequence of observable events that are
        part of some given regular language) instead of the occurrence of a single fault.
