## Abstract
This paper takes you behind the scenes of the Model Checking Contest (MCC), an annual
        competition focusing on the behavioral analysis of asynchronous systems using state-space
        exploration and model checking techniques.

The MCC is part of a thriving group of scientific events dedicated to provide a fair
        evaluation of formal analysis tools, with the goal to push forward the state of the art and
        provide insights into the evolution of the involved technologies and approaches. We give
        details on the organization of the competition and on the ways we manage models and
        formulas. We also take a look at the evolution of the results over the 2018—2023 period,
        using the wide variety of data we collect each year, and report on the impact the MCC had on
        the competing tools.
