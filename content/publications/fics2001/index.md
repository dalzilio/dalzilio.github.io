## Abstract
We present an extension of the ambient logic with fixed points operators in the style of
        the μ-calculus. We give a simple syntactic condition for the equivalence between
        minimal and maximal fixpoint formulas and show how to subsume spatial analogues of the usual
        box and diamond operators.
