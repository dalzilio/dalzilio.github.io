## Abstract
Software is an essential part of robotic systems. As robots and autonomous systems are more
        and more deployed in human environments, we need to use elaborate validation and
        verification techniques in order to gain a higher level of trust in our systems. This
        motivates our determination to apply formal verification methods to robotics software. In
        this paper, we describe our results obtained using model-checking on the functional layer of
        an autonomous robot. We implement an automatic translation from GenoM, a robotics
        model-based software engineering framework, to the formal specification language Fiacre.
        This translation takes into account the semantics of the robotics middleware. TINA, our
        model-checking toolbox, can be used on the synthesized models to prove real-time properties
        of the functional modules implementation on the robot. We illustrate our approach using a
        realistic autonomous navigation example.
