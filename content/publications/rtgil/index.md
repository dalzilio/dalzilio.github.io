## Abstract
 We define a graphical language for expressing timed requirements on concurrent systems.
        This formal language, called _Timed Graphical Interval Logic_ (TGIL), is inspired by
        realtime extensions of Dillon's et al Graphical Interval Logic and can be used as an
        alternative to timed extensions of temporal logic. We define the semantics of TGIL as a set
        of timed traces (using a dense time semantics) and illustrate its use in formal verification
        by describing a method for generating an observer from a TGIL specification.
