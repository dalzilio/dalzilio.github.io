## Abstract
In a previous work, we proposed an extension of the AltaRica language and tools to deal
        with the modelling and analysis of failures propagation in presence of timed and temporal
        constraints. This need is crucial in the space industry, where safety functionalities raise
        new challenges for the early validation of systems during model conception. This paper
        focuses on the application of our approach to the Failure Detection Isolation and Recovery
        (FDIR) mechanisms of the Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) of a satellite. We discuss
        the modelling methodology applied to this system and its properties, as well as the
        tractability of the model-checking analysis.
