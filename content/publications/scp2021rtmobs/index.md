## Abstract
We define a new verification method, called RT-MOBS, for checking real-time requirements
        based on Time Petri nets (TPN). Our approach supports requirements specified using a very
        expressive pattern language, the Property Specification Language (PSL) of Autili, Grusnke et
        al., and relies on marking observers' verification. RT-MOBS has many distinctive features,
        such as a focus on performances, a compositional method for deriving the observer and the
        target property directly from the structure of the specification pattern, and the ability to
        deal with the whole real-time fragment of PSL. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
        approach from three industrial use cases: a mobile ad-hoc network system; the model of a
        flight management system, which is realistic with respect to the industry use during the
        architecture evaluation phase; and a model of an order to cash smart contract. Our
        experimental results show that we can achieve performances that are several orders of
        magnitude better than with methods based on an interpretation of patterns into Linear
        Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas.
