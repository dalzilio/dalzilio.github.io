## Abstract
Model Checking is a formal technique for the verification of finite systems. However, it is
        well known that this technique suffers from the state explosion problem. We describe work in
        progress to implement in the TINA toolbox an enumerative variant of a state based
        observation graph algorithm defined by Klai and Poitrenaud.
