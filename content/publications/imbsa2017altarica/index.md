## Abstract
The design of complex safety critical systems raises new technical challenges for the
        industry. As systems become more complex—and include more and more interacting functions—it
        becomes harder to evaluate the safety implications of local failures and their possible
        propagation through a whole system. That is all the more true when we add time to the
        problem, that is when we consider the impact of computation times and delays on the
        propagation of failures. We describe an approach that extends models developed for Safety
        Analysis with timing information and provide tools to reason on the correctness of temporal
        safety conditions. Our approach is based on an extension of the AltaRica language where we
        can associate timing constraints with events and relies on a translation into a realtime
        model-checking toolset. We illustrate our method with an example that is representative of
        safety architectures found in critical systems.
