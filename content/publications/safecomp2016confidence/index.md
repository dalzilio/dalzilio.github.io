## Abstract
A problem hindering the adoption of formal methods in the industry is how to integrate the
        models and results used during formal verification with existing processes. Indeed, formal
        verification is a complex process involving multiple methods, models, level of formality,
        ... If we want to use formal verification results in an assurance case, it is therefore
        necessary to build confidence on this process. The integration of formal methods raises
        particular problems like, for instance, with the construction of the verification models: a
        model may not preserve all properties of the system to be verified; it may only cover a
        subset of these properties; or it may be intractable. In practice, this means that the
        verification process involves a collection of models whose soundness (with the original
        system design, but also between each others) shall be justified. Furthermore, formal
        techniques are usually restricted in terms of the set of properties that can be checked. It
        is therefore necessary to justify (and trace back) that these restrictions are consistent
        with the hypotheses made about the system, its application and its environment. This short
        abstract gives an overview of a methodology for building verification arguments, that is
        convincing arguments that a system design complies with a set of properties.
