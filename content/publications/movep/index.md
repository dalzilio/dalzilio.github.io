## Abstract
We propose a short bibliographic survey of calculi for mobile processes. Contrasting with
        other similar exercises, we consider two related, but distinct, notions of mobile processes,
        namely labile processes, which can exhibit changes of their interaction structure, as
        modelled in the pi-calculus, and motile processes, which can exhibit movement, as modelled
        in the ambient calculus of Cardelli and Gordon. A common attribute of the algebraic
        frameworks presented in this paper is that they all rely on a notion of name as first class
        value.
