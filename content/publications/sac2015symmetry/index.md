## Abstract
We propose a method to exploit the symmetries of a realtime system represented by a Time
        Petri net for its verification by model-checking. The method handles both markings and
        timing constraints; it can be used in conjunction with the widely used state classes
        abstraction. The approach has been implemented and experiments are reported.
