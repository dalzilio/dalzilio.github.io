## Abstract
MCC is a tool designed for a very specific task: to transform the models of High-Level
        Petri nets, given in the PNML syntax, into equivalent Place/Transition nets. The name of the
        tool derives from the annual Model-Checking Contest, a competition of model-checking tools
        that provides a large and diverse collection of PNML models. This choice in naming serves to
        underline the main focus of the tool, which is to provide an open and efficient solution
        that lowers the access cost for developers wanting to engage in this competition. We
        describe the architecture and functionalities of our tool and show how it compares with
        other existing solutions. Despite the fact that the problem we target is abundantly covered
        in the literature, we show that it is still possible to innovate. To substantiate this
        assertion, we put a particular emphasis on two distinctive features of MCC that have proved
        useful when dealing with some of the most challenging colored models in the contest, namely
        the use of a restricted notion of higher-order invariant, and the support of a Petri net
        scripting language.
