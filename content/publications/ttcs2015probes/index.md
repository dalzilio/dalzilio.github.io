## Abstract
A classical method for model-checking timed properties, such as those expressed using timed
        extensions of temporal logic, is to rely on the use of observers. In this context, a major
        problem is to prove the correctness of observers. Essentially, this boils down to proving
        that: (1) every trace that contradicts a property can be detected by the observer; but also
        that (2) the observer is innocuous, meaning that it cannot interfere with the system under
        observation. In this paper, we describe a method for automatically testing the correctness
        of realtime observers. This method is obtained by automating an approach often referred to
        as visual verification, in which the correctness of a system is performed by inspecting a
        graphical representation of its state space. Our approach has been implemented on the tool
        Tina, a model-checking toolbox for Time Petri Net.
