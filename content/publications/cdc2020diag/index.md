## Abstract
We propose a method to decide the diagnosability of patterns in labeled Time Petri nets
        (TPN) that gracefully extends a classic approach for the diagnosability of single faults.
        Our approach is based on a new technique for computing the language intersection of TPN and
        on an associated extension of the State Class Graph construction. Our approach has been
        implemented and we report on some experimental results.
