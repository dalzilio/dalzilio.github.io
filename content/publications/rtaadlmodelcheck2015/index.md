## Abstract
We describe a model-checking toolchain for the behavioral verification of AADL models that
        takes into account the realtime semantics of the language and that is compatible with the
        AADL Behavioral Annex. We give a high-level view of the tools and transformations involved
        in the verification process and focus on the support offered by our framework for checking
        user-defined properties. We also describe the experimental results obtained on a significant
        avionic demonstrator, that models a network protocol in charge of data communications
        between an airplane and ground stations.
