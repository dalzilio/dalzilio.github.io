## Abstract
The Model Checking Contest (MCC) is an annual competition of software tools for model
        checking. Tools must process an increasing benchmark gathered from the whole community and
        may participate in various examinations: state space generation, computation of global
        properties, computation of some upper bounds in the model, evaluation of reachability
        formulas, evaluation of CTL formulas, and evaluation of LTL formulas. For each examination
        and each model instance, participating tools are provided with up to 3600s and 16 gigabyte
        of memory. Then, tool answers are analyzed and confronted to the results produced by other
        competing tools to detect diverging answers (which are quite rare at this stage of the
        competition, and lead to penalties). For each examination, golden, silver, and bronze medals
        are attributed to the three best tools. CPU usage and memory consumption are reported, which
        is also valuable information for tool developers.
